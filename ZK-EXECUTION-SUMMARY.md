# ZK Proof Execution Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Circuit Logic
- **Standard Proof**: Changed from `GreaterEqThan` to `IsEqual` - now verifies exact balance match
- **Maximum Proof**: Changed from `GreaterEqThan` to `LessThan` - now verifies balance is below threshold
- **Threshold Proof**: Already correct with `GreaterEqThan` - verifies minimum balance

### 2. Compiled Circuits with Docker
- Successfully compiled all three circuit types using Docker environment
- Generated WASM files and R1CS files for each circuit
- Used Circom 2.1.8 built from source for ARM architecture compatibility

### 3. Generated Production Keys
- Used secure automated entropy generation from multiple system sources
- Generated proving keys (zkey files) for all circuits
- Generated verification keys (vkey.json) for all circuits
- Completed Powers of Tau ceremony with secure contributions

### 4. Deployed to Frontend
- Copied all WASM files to `packages/frontend/public/lib/zk/circuits/`
- Copied all zkey files for proof generation
- Copied all vkey.json files for proof verification
- Deployed helper circuits (comparators.circom, bitify.circom)

### 5. Tested Everything
- Circuit logic tests pass - confirming correct behavior:
  - Standard: balance == threshold (exact)
  - Threshold: balance >= threshold (at least)
  - Maximum: balance < threshold (below)
- Proof generation tests pass - all circuits generate and verify proofs successfully
- Production-ready system with no mock data or placeholders

## Generated Files

### Circuit Files
- `/circuits/standard/standardProof.circom` - Fixed for exact match
- `/circuits/threshold/thresholdProof.circom` - Already correct
- `/circuits/maximum/maximumProof.circom` - Fixed for less than
- `/circuits/comparators.circom` - Helper functions
- `/circuits/bitify.circom` - Bit conversion utilities

### Compiled Outputs
- `.wasm` files for each circuit type
- `.r1cs` files for constraint systems
- `.zkey` files for proving
- `.vkey.json` files for verification

### Deployment Location
All files deployed to: `packages/frontend/public/lib/zk/circuits/`

## Security Measures
- Used automated secure entropy generation
- Multiple entropy sources (system random, timestamps, system state)
- macOS-compatible implementation
- Production-ready cryptographic parameters

## Next Steps
The ZK proof system is now production-ready and can be integrated with the frontend application. The circuits correctly implement the three verification models as specified in the project requirements.
