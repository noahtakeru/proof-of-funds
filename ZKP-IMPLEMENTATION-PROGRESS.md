### Phase 1.2: Temporary Wallet System (PENDING)
- ðŸ”² Implement BIP44 derivation in wallet helpers
- ðŸ”² Create wallet lifecycle management functions
- ðŸ”² Add state management for temporary wallets

### Phase 1.3: GCP Infrastructure Setup (PENDING)
- ðŸ”² Set up GCP account and configure permissions
- ðŸ”² Create Secret Manager resources
- ðŸ”² Configure appropriate service accounts

## Phase 2: Verification System (NOT STARTED)

## Phase 4: Production Ready (NOT STARTED)

## Implementation Notes

### Latest Updates (May 29, 2024)
- Completed Phase 0.2 with comprehensive database infrastructure including complete migration system
- Completed Phase 0.3 with modular backend architecture and full test coverage
- Completed Phase 0.4 with comprehensive test infrastructure and enhanced test coverage
- Performed extensive code consolidation for ZK scripts and utilities:
  - Consolidated ZK execution scripts into a single robust script with multiple modes
  - Unified key generation scripts with platform-aware functionality
  - Combined entropy generation scripts for Linux and macOS
  - Consolidated ZK utility JavaScript files and test scripts
  - Created backward compatibility wrappers to ensure existing code continues to work
- Ready to begin Phase 1.1: ZK Proof Generation Module

### Technical Decisions
- Using Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Implementing proper connection pooling for production-level performance
- Using JWT for authentication with refresh token support
- Implementing feature-based module organization for maintainability
- Using Docker for isolated testing environments
- Implementing GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Using a comprehensive indexing strategy for query performance

### Next Steps
1. Implement ZK Proof Generation Module
2. Implement Temporary Wallet System
3. Set up GCP Infrastructure

### Areas of Strength
- Comprehensive database schema with proper migrations
- Robust connection pooling with performance optimization
- Clean, modular backend architecture
- Thorough test coverage with proper isolation
- Strong error handling throughout the codebase
- Detailed documentation of implementation decisions
