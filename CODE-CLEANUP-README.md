# Code Cleanup and Consolidation

This document explains the recent code cleanup and consolidation efforts performed on the Proof of Funds codebase.

## Consolidated Files

### 1. GCP Test Scripts

The following scripts were consolidated:
- `scripts/test-cloud-storage.js` and `scripts/test-cloud-storage-permissions.js` → `scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js`

The new consolidated script provides a unified interface for testing:
```bash
# Test everything
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js

# Test just permissions
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js permissions

# Test just storage manager
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js storage-manager
```

### 2. GCP Deployment Utilities

The redundant code between these files was consolidated:
- `scripts/verify-gcp-deployment.js` and `scripts/configure-gcp-project.sh` → `scripts/gcp-deployment-utils.js`

The new structure has:
- A common `gcp-deployment-utils.js` module with shared functionality
- Simplified scripts that import from the common module

### 3. GCP Documentation

Multiple overlapping documentation files were consolidated into a single comprehensive guide:
- `docs/GCP-INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/GCP-README.md`
- `docs/GCP-SETUP.md`
- Various findings in `docs/findings/`

The new consolidated guide is at:
- `docs/GCP-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

### 4. Environment File

Renamed for clarity:
- `temp.env` → `.env.example`

## Backward Compatibility

All consolidated files maintain backward compatibility through:
- Original files that import functionality from consolidated modules
- Maintaining the same command-line interface and behavior
- Preserving original file paths with references to new implementations

## Benefits

This consolidation effort has:
1. Reduced code duplication by centralizing common functionality
2. Improved maintainability by having a single source of truth
3. Enhanced documentation through comprehensive guides
4. Simplified the codebase structure
5. Made future modifications easier by centralizing shared code

## Testing

All consolidated files have been tested to ensure they maintain the same functionality as the original files. The tests include:
- Testing GCP storage functionality
- Verifying GCP deployment
- Generating setup instructions
- Maintaining original script behavior

## Next Steps

Further consolidation could include:
1. Additional test file consolidation
2. Standardizing error handling across scripts
3. Creating a unified CLI for GCP operations
4. Improving test coverage for consolidated modules

## Usage Examples

### Testing GCP Storage
```bash
# Test all functionality
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js

# Test specific aspects
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js permissions
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js storage-manager
```

### Verifying GCP Deployment
```bash
# Verify deployment
node scripts/verify-gcp-deployment.js
```

### Configuring GCP Project
```bash
# Configure project
./scripts/configure-gcp-project.sh
```
