# Code Cleanup and Consolidation

This document explains the recent code cleanup and consolidation efforts performed on the Proof of Funds codebase.

## Consolidated Files

### 1. GCP Test Scripts

The following scripts were consolidated:
- `scripts/test-cloud-storage.js` and `scripts/test-cloud-storage-permissions.js` → `scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js`

The new consolidated script provides a unified interface for testing:
```bash
# Test everything
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js

# Test just permissions
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js permissions

# Test just storage manager
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js storage-manager
```

### 2. GCP Deployment Utilities

The redundant code between these files was consolidated:
- `scripts/verify-gcp-deployment.js` and `scripts/configure-gcp-project.sh` → `scripts/gcp-deployment-utils.js`

The new structure has:
- A common `gcp-deployment-utils.js` module with shared functionality
- Simplified scripts that import from the common module

### 3. GCP Documentation

Multiple overlapping documentation files were consolidated into a single comprehensive guide:
- `docs/GCP-INTEGRATION.md`
- `docs/GCP-README.md`
- `docs/GCP-SETUP.md`
- `docs/EXISTING-GCP-INTEGRATION.md`
- Various findings in `docs/findings/`

The new consolidated guide is at:
- `docs/GCP-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

### 4. Environment File

Renamed for clarity:
- `temp.env` → `.env.example`

### 5. Key Deployment Scripts

Consolidated deployment scripts for keys:
- `scripts/deploy-keys-to-gcp.js` and `scripts/deploy-keys-to-storage.js` → `scripts/deploy-keys.js`

The new script supports multiple storage backends with a unified interface:
```bash
# Auto-detect the best storage based on file size
node scripts/deploy-keys.js

# Use Secret Manager specifically
node scripts/deploy-keys.js --storage=secret-manager

# Use Cloud Storage specifically
node scripts/deploy-keys.js --storage=cloud-storage

# Deploy specific circuits
node scripts/deploy-keys.js --circuits=standard,threshold
```

### 6. Entropy Generation Scripts

Removed redundant entropy generation scripts that were already consolidated:
- `scripts/generate-secure-entropy.sh` (now part of `scripts/generate-keys.sh`)
- `scripts/automated-ceremony-coordinator.js` (redundant with consolidated key generation)
- `scripts/run-automated-ceremony.js` (redundant with consolidated key generation)

### 7. Docker Utilities

Extracted shared Docker setup logic into a common utility:
- `scripts/docker-utils.sh`

This script provides common functions used across ZK execution scripts:
- `setup_docker_environment` - For setting up the Docker environment
- `run_docker_compilation` - For running circuit compilation in Docker
- `run_docker_key_generation` - For running key generation in Docker

## Backward Compatibility

All consolidated files maintain backward compatibility through:
- Original files that import functionality from consolidated modules
- Maintaining the same command-line interface and behavior
- Preserving original file paths with references to new implementations

## Benefits

This consolidation effort has:
1. Reduced code duplication by centralizing common functionality
2. Improved maintainability by having a single source of truth
3. Enhanced documentation through comprehensive guides
4. Simplified the codebase structure
5. Made future modifications easier by centralizing shared code
6. Created consistent patterns for command-line interfaces
7. Improved platform compatibility with auto-detection

## Testing

All consolidated files have been tested to ensure they maintain the same functionality as the original files. The tests include:
- Testing GCP storage functionality
- Verifying GCP deployment
- Generating setup instructions
- Maintaining original script behavior
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS)

## Next Steps

Further consolidation could include:
1. Additional test file consolidation
2. Standardizing error handling across scripts
3. Creating a unified CLI for ZK operations
4. Improving test coverage for consolidated modules
5. Integrating Docker utilities into all ZK scripts

## Usage Examples

### Testing GCP Storage
```bash
# Test all functionality
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js

# Test specific aspects
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js permissions
node scripts/test-cloud-storage-util.js storage-manager
```

### Verifying GCP Deployment
```bash
# Verify deployment
node scripts/verify-gcp-deployment.js
```

### Configuring GCP Project
```bash
# Configure project
./scripts/configure-gcp-project.sh
```

### Deploying ZK Keys
```bash
# Deploy with auto-detection
node scripts/deploy-keys.js

# Use specific storage
node scripts/deploy-keys.js --storage=cloud-storage

# Deploy specific circuits
node scripts/deploy-keys.js --circuits=standard,threshold
```

### Using Docker Utilities
```bash
# In a bash script
source ./scripts/docker-utils.sh
setup_docker_environment "$PROJECT_ROOT"
run_docker_compilation "$PROJECT_ROOT"
```
