/*
 * Threshold Proof Circuit (version 1.0.0)
 * Proves that balance is at least the threshold amount
 * 
 * Input:
 * - address: Public input, the wallet address
 * - threshold: Public input, the minimum amount
 * - actualBalance: Private input, the actual balance amount
 * - nonce: Private input, random value to prevent correlation
 * - signature: Private input, signature proving ownership of wallet
 *
 * Optimization goals:
 * - Constraint count target: <15,000 constraints
 * - Uses Poseidon hash for efficient ZK operations
 * - Optimized comparison operations
 * - Reduced constraint complexity for signature verification
