# Testing the Trusted Setup Process

This directory contains tests for the TrustedSetupManager, ParameterValidator, and key distribution infrastructure developed for Week 4 Task 1.

## Quick Test Method

The fastest and most reliable way to test the Week 4 Task 1 implementation is:

```bash
# From the project root
node --input-type=module -e "import './lib/zk/__tests__/ceremony/test-ceremony.js'"
```

This simple test demonstrates all the key functionality including:
- Ceremony initialization with multiple distribution channels
- Participant registration and management
- Parameter contribution and validation
- Verification key generation with security guarantees
- Key distribution through configured channels
- Ceremony verification with multiple verifiers
- Verification key retrieval from the registry

## Alternative Testing Methods

If you prefer, you can also run the comprehensive manual test:

```bash
# From the project root
node --experimental-vm-modules lib/zk/__tests__/ceremony/manual-test.js
```

## Implementation Details

The Week 4 Task 1 implementation includes:

1. **Enhanced TrustedSetupManager.js**
   - Integrated with ParameterValidator for comprehensive validation
   - Added audit logging for security events
   - Implemented verification key generation with security guarantees
   - Added multi-channel key distribution with redundancy

2. **ParameterValidator.js**
   - Provides thorough parameter validation
   - Implements chain of trust verification
   - Validates cryptographic properties of parameters and keys

3. **SecurityAuditLogger.js**
   - Audit trails for security events
   - Tamper-evident logging chain

## Expected Test Results

When running the tests, you should see output indicating successful:
- Ceremony initialization
- Participant registration
- Contribution submission and validation
- Ceremony finalization
- Verification key generation
- Ceremony verification
- Verification key retrieval

The tests confirm that all aspects of the Week 4 Task 1 requirements have been implemented successfully.

## Manual Verification Steps

To manually verify specific aspects of the implementation:

1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - Examine ParameterValidator.js to verify comprehensive validation
   - See the integration in TrustedSetupManager.submitContribution() and finalizeCeremony()

2. **Verification Key Generation**:
   - Check the enhanced generateVerificationKey() method
   - Verify security guarantees including tamper-evidence, integrity verification, and cryptographic structure

3. **Key Distribution**:
   - Look at the distributeVerificationKey() method
   - Verify multi-channel distribution with redundancy
   - Check signed receipts for distributied keys

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Examine SecurityAuditLogger integration throughout TrustedSetupManager
   - Verify comprehensive logging of security events

These verification steps will confirm that the Week 4 Task 1 implementation meets all requirements.
