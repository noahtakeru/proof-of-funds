# Development Environment Setup Testing Guide

This document provides instructions for verifying that the Development Environment Setup for the ZK infrastructure is working correctly.

## Verification Steps

1. **Test the Types Compilation**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit lib/zk/types.ts lib/zk/circuitVersions.ts
   ```
   This command should complete without errors, indicating that the TypeScript types are correctly defined.

2. **Run the Setup Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:zk
   ```
   This runs a basic test that verifies the project structure and file content. All tests should pass.

3. **Verify Project Structure**:
   ```
   lib/zk/
   ├── build/              # Compiled circuit outputs
   ├── circuits/           # Circuit definitions
   │   ├── maximumProof.circom
   │   ├── standardProof.circom
   │   └── thresholdProof.circom
   ├── keys/               # Trusted setup keys
   ├── scripts/            # Build and utility scripts
   │   └── build-circuits.js
   ├── types.ts            # Type definitions
   ├── wasmLoader.ts       # WebAssembly handling
   ├── snarkjsLoader.ts    # snarkjs integration
   ├── circuitVersions.ts  # Circuit versioning
   ├── progressTracker.ts  # Progress reporting
   ├── circuitBuilder.ts   # Circuit build pipeline
   └── testUtils.ts        # Testing utilities
   ```

4. **Check Build Script**:
   ```bash
   node lib/zk/scripts/build-circuits.js
   ```
   This will attempt to build the circuits. Note that this requires `circom` to be installed globally, so it may fail if that dependency is not met. In a real environment, this would download the Phase 1 Powers of Tau file and compile the circuits.

## Expected Results

When the development environment is set up correctly:

1. TypeScript compilation succeeds
2. Tests pass
3. Project structure matches the expected layout
4. Dependencies are correctly configured in package.json

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Check that the type definitions in types.ts match the usage in other files
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Verify that snarkjs and circomlib are installed
3. **Test Failures**: Check the failing tests for specific issues
4. **Build Errors**: Ensure that the build script has the correct paths
