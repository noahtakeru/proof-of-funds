/**
 * Gas Management System for Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification
 * 
 * A comprehensive system for estimating, tracking, and optimizing gas costs
 * for on-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs.
 * 
 * This module provides:
 * 1. Gas cost estimation for different proof types
 * 2. Batch processing optimization for gas efficiency
 * 3. Real-time gas price monitoring
 * 4. Gas usage profiling and analysis
 * 
 * ---------- NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY ----------
 * This module helps manage the "fuel" needed to run our privacy system on the blockchain.
 * Think of it like a sophisticated fuel management system for a vehicle fleet:
 * 
 * 1. COST ESTIMATION: Predict how much "fuel" (gas) different operations will use
 * 2. BATCH OPTIMIZATION: Package multiple operations together for efficiency
 * 3. PRICE MONITORING: Track the current "fuel price" to optimize timing
 * 4. USAGE ANALYSIS: Identify which operations use the most fuel and how to optimize
 * 
 * Business value: Ensures our privacy system runs cost-effectively on the blockchain,
 * provides predictable cost structures for users, and optimizes operations to minimize fees.
