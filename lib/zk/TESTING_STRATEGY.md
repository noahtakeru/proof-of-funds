# Zero-Knowledge Proof System Testing Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Zero-Knowledge Proof infrastructure, ensuring that both mock-based tests and real cryptographic tests are used to validate functionality.

## 1. Testing Layers

Our testing approach is divided into four distinct layers:

### Layer 1: Unit Tests with Mocks
- Uses mock implementations of cryptographic operations
- Fast execution for quick feedback during development
- Tests individual components in isolation
- Verifies correct logic and behavior without cryptographic overhead

### Layer 2: Integration Tests with Real Cryptography
- Uses actual snarkjs/circom implementations
- Performs real ZK proof generation and verification
- Tests integration between components with real cryptographic operations
- Validates that mock behavior accurately reflects real behavior

### Layer 3: Cross-Environment Tests
- Tests functionality across different environments:
  - Browser environments (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Node.js server environment
  - Mobile browsers
  - Low-capability devices
- Verifies that client/server switching works correctly in different environments

### Layer 4: End-to-End System Tests
- Tests complete user flows from UI through to blockchain
- Includes on-chain verification tests
- Validates that proofs generated in one context can be verified in another
- Tests actual deployment scenarios with realistic user journeys

## 2. Mock Validation Approach

To ensure our mocks accurately reflect real behavior:

### 2.1 Behavior Equivalence Testing
- Create a set of "golden" test vectors with known inputs and outputs
- Run tests using both real and mock implementations
- Compare results to ensure mock behavior matches real behavior
- Document differences and ensure they don't affect test validity

### 2.2 Explicit Mock Specifications
- Document exactly what each mock is simulating
- Specify expected behavior for each function
- Track changes to mocks alongside changes to real implementations
- Review mocks when real implementations change

### 2.3 Mock Fidelity Metrics
- Define metrics for how closely mocks model real behavior
- Monitor divergence between mock and real behavior over time
- Set thresholds for acceptable differences
- Refactor mocks when they drift too far from real implementation

## 3. Real Cryptographic Testing

For real cryptographic testing:

### 3.1 Circuit Testing
- Test each circuit with actual inputs and outputs
- Verify that constraints are satisfied
- Check edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test with both valid and invalid inputs

### 3.2 Proof Generation Testing
- Generate actual ZK proofs using real wallet data (test wallets only)
- Measure performance with different input sizes
- Verify proof structure and format
- Confirm compatibility with verification process

### 3.3 Proof Verification Testing
- Verify generated proofs using real verification keys
- Test verification with different proof types and parameters
- Validate behavior with both valid and invalid proofs
- Measure verification performance

### 3.4 Key Management Testing
- Test creation and management of real keys
- Verify secure storage and retrieval
- Test key rotation and destruction
- Validate behavior with different key types

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Phase 1: Enhance Current Tests
- Improve mock implementations to better model real behavior
- Document expected behavior of each mock function
- Create a validation framework for comparing mock vs. real behavior
- Add more comprehensive test cases

### 4.2 Phase 2: Add Real Cryptographic Tests
- Implement test vectors with real cryptographic operations
- Create dedicated test runners for cryptographic tests
- Set up performance benchmarking for real operations
- Establish baseline performance metrics

### 4.3 Phase 3: Cross-Environment Testing
- Set up browser testing environment (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright)
- Create Node.js-specific tests
- Implement mobile browser simulation tests
- Test different capability scenarios

### 4.4 Phase 4: End-to-End System Tests
- Create UI test automation
- Set up local blockchain for testing (e.g., Hardhat)
- Create complete user journey tests
- Test deployment scenarios

## 5. Test Environments

### 5.1 Local Development Environment
- Uses mock implementations by default
- Provides fast feedback during development
- Can optionally run real cryptographic tests
- Focuses on unit and integration tests

### 5.2 CI/CD Pipeline Environment
- Runs all test types on each pull request
- Uses parallelization for faster test execution
- Maintains comprehensive test coverage metrics
- Enforces test passing thresholds

### 5.3 Staging Environment
- Runs end-to-end tests in a production-like setting
- Tests with realistic data volumes
- Verifies performance under load
- Validates cross-component integration

### 5.4 Production Environment
- Runs smoke tests to verify deployment
- Collects real-world telemetry
- Monitors actual user behavior
- Feeds back into test improvement

## 6. Mock Implementation Guidelines

To ensure our mocks provide valuable testing:

### 6.1 Mock Behavior Principles
- Mocks should reflect real behavior for both success and failure cases
- All edge cases handled by real implementation should be modeled by mocks
- Performance characteristics should be proportional (if not identical)
- Error handling should match real implementation

### 6.2 Mock Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Clearly document what the mock is simulating
- [ ] Handle all input variations that would affect real implementation
- [ ] Return structured data that matches real implementation
- [ ] Throw errors in the same scenarios as real implementation
- [ ] Add comments explaining any intentional deviations from real behavior
- [ ] Include validation logic to ensure input/output consistency

### 6.3 When to Use Real Implementation vs. Mocks
- Use real implementation when:
  - Testing cryptographic correctness
  - Measuring actual performance
  - Validating end-to-end flows
  - Testing system integration
- Use mocks when:
  - Testing logic that depends on cryptographic operations
  - Running frequent development cycles
  - Testing error handling and edge cases
  - Simulating hard-to-reproduce scenarios

## 7. Test Data Management

### 7.1 Test Vectors
- Create comprehensive test vectors for different scenarios
- Include both valid and invalid inputs
- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
- Document expected outputs for each input

### 7.2 Test Wallets
- Use dedicated test wallets with known private keys
- Never use production wallets in tests
- Generate test wallets programmatically when needed
- Rotate test wallet keys periodically

### 7.3 Generated Test Data
- Generate test data that covers all relevant scenarios
- Include varying complexity levels
- Create data for different performance profiles
- Document data generation process for reproducibility

## 8. Metrics and Reporting

### 8.1 Test Coverage Metrics
- Code coverage: aim for >90% coverage of non-cryptographic code

- Edge case coverage: ensure all identified edge cases are tested
- Cross-environment coverage: track tests across different environments

### 8.2 Performance Metrics
- Proof generation time for different input sizes and proof types
