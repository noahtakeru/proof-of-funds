# ZK Infrastructure Reorganization Report

## Summary

The ZK infrastructure has been reorganized for better maintainability and documentation.

## Directory Structure

- `backup`
- `build`
- `circuits`
- `circuits-clean`
- `circuits-v0.5`
- `config`
- `docker`
- `docs`
- `html`
- `keys`
- `minimal-circuits`
- `patched-circomlib`
- `patched-circuits`
- `scripts`
- `src`
- `test-inputs`
- `tests`

## Changes Made

1. **Documentation Organization**
   - Created a `docs` directory with separate subdirectories for:
     - `reports`: Progress and status reports
     - `guides`: Usage and implementation guides
     - `implementation`: Implementation plans and specifications
     - `general`: General documentation
   - Added a comprehensive `DOCUMENTATION.md` index file

2. **Test Organization**
   - Created a `tests` directory with separate subdirectories for:
     - `unit`: Unit tests
     - `benchmarks`: Benchmark test files
     - `regression`: Regression test files
     - `docs`: Test documentation

3. **Source Code Organization**
   - Moved all JavaScript and TypeScript source files to `src/` directory
   - Created a `config/` directory for configuration files
   - Created a `scripts/` directory for shell scripts

4. **Build and Circuit Organization**
   - Organized circuit files in `circuits/` directory
   - Moved build artifacts to the `build/` directory
   - Consolidated HTML test files in `html/` directory
   - Moved Docker configuration to `docker/` directory

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Clearer separation of concerns
   - Easier to locate specific files
   - Better organization of related files

2. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Centralized documentation index
   - Better categorized documentation files
   - Clear structure for finding information

3. **Better Test Organization**
   - Separated tests by type
   - Consolidated test documentation
   - Improved test script organization

4. **Future Development**
   - Easier onboarding for new contributors
   - Clearer paths for adding new features
   - Better structure for continuous integration

## Next Steps

1. **Update Import Paths**
   - Review source files for any broken imports
   - Update import paths to reflect the new directory structure
   - Use the provided `scripts/update-imports.sh` script to assist

2. **Update Build Scripts**
   - Update build scripts to work with the new directory structure
   - Ensure all build artifacts are properly located

3. **Update Documentation References**
   - Review documentation for outdated file path references
   - Update references to match the new directory structure

4. **Testing**
   - Run all tests to ensure they work with the new structure
   - Update test configurations as needed
