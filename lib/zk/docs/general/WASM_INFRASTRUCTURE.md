# WebAssembly Infrastructure for ZK Proofs

This document describes the WebAssembly (WASM) infrastructure implemented for the Zero-Knowledge Proof system.

## Overview

The WebAssembly infrastructure is responsible for:

1. Detecting WebAssembly support in the client's environment
2. Loading and managing WASM modules efficiently
3. Handling errors and providing fallbacks when WebAssembly isn't available
4. Optimizing performance through caching and Web Workers
5. Determining device capabilities to make intelligent processing decisions

## Key Components

### 1. WebAssembly Detection (`detectWasmSupport`)

This function detects WebAssembly support and capabilities:
- Checks for basic WebAssembly support
- Tests for SIMD, threads, bulk memory, and exceptions support
- Returns detailed feature availability information

### 2. Module Loading (`loadWasmModule`)

Handles loading and compiling WebAssembly modules:
- Optimized for performance with progress reporting
- Error handling with specific error types
- Timeout support to prevent blocking
- Caching to avoid redundant downloads

### 3. Worker-Based Loading (`loadWasmModuleInWorker`)

Loads WebAssembly modules in a separate thread:
- Prevents UI blocking during intensive operations
- Provides progress reporting
- Handles errors and timeouts
- Creates workers on-demand with inline scripts

### 4. Capability Detection (`checkPerformanceCapabilities`)

Analyzes device capabilities:
- Detects hardware concurrency and memory
- Checks WebAssembly support
- Determines if the device is low-powered
- Recommends client-side or server-side processing

### 5. Main API (`wasmLoader`)

Provides a simple, unified interface:
- Singleton instance for easy access
- Initializes infrastructure with progress reporting
- Automatically selects optimal loading strategy
- Manages caching and provides capability information

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization

```javascript
import { wasmLoader } from './lib/zk/wasmLoader';

// Initialize the WASM infrastructure
await wasmLoader.initialize();

// Check if WebAssembly is supported
if (wasmLoader.isWasmSupported()) {
  console.log('WebAssembly is supported!');
}

// Check if client-side processing is recommended
if (wasmLoader.isClientSideRecommended()) {
  // Proceed with client-side proof generation
} else {
  // Use server-side fallback
}
```

### Loading a WASM Module

```javascript
import { wasmLoader } from './lib/zk/wasmLoader';

// Load a WASM module with progress reporting
const module = await wasmLoader.loadModule('/circuits/standard_v1_0_0.wasm', {
  useCache: true, // Use caching (default: true)
  useWorker: true, // Use Web Worker if available (default: true)
  onProgress: (percent) => {
    console.log(`Loading: ${percent}%`);
  }
});

// Use the module for proof generation
// ...

// Clear cache if needed
wasmLoader.clearCache();
```

## Fallback Mechanisms

The infrastructure includes several fallback mechanisms:

1. **Feature Detection**: Gracefully handles environments without WebAssembly
2. **Worker Fallbacks**: Falls back to main thread if Web Workers aren't supported
3. **Environment Analysis**: Recommends server-side processing for low-powered devices
4. **Error Recovery**: Handles network errors, compilation errors, and timeouts

## Testing

The WebAssembly infrastructure includes tests that verify:
- WebAssembly support detection works correctly
- Performance capability detection provides expected results
- Module loading and caching work as expected
- The API functions correctly in different environments

Run the tests with:
```
npm run test:zk
```

## Memory Management

Special care has been taken to manage memory efficiently:
- Modules are cached to avoid redundant compilations
- Loading large modules in Web Workers prevents UI blocking
- Progress reporting allows for better user experience during long operations
- Device capability detection prevents attempting operations that may crash the browser
