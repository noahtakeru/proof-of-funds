# Phase 4 Implementation Tracking

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of Phase 4 implementation tasks for the ZK module. It serves as a central reference for all work completed, in progress, and planned.

## Tasks Status

| Task | Status | Assignee | Started | Completed | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| JSDoc Documentation | Complete | | 2024-06-xx | 2024-06-xx | Fixed documentation warnings in zkCircuitParameterDerivation.mjs |
| Error Handling Refactor | Complete | | 2024-06-xx | 2024-06-xx | Modified SystemError import in zkUtils |
| Real Wallet Test Harness | Complete | | 2024-06-xx | 2024-06-xx | Implemented end-to-end test harness for real wallet testing on Polygon Amoy testnet |

## Current Work Items

### Documentation Improvements
- Completed JSDoc documentation for zkCircuitParameterDerivation.mjs
- Ensured proper export documentation

### Error Handling Refinements
- Fixed SystemError import in zkUtils.js and zkUtils.mjs
- Resolved Promise-related issues with error class inheritance

### Test Harness Implementation
- Created WalletFixture.js for managing test wallets
- Created TestnetProvider.js for testnet connections with Polygon Amoy support
- Created ProofVerificationE2E.js for end-to-end testing
- Implemented testing for all three proof types (standard, threshold, maximum)
- Added comprehensive reporting and error handling
- Ensured all components work with Polygon networks, specifically Amoy testnet
- Implemented currency-aware reporting (MATIC instead of ETH)
- Added network-specific configuration and gas handling for Polygon

## Upcoming Tasks
- TBD based on upcoming requirements

## Notes
- All implementation follows the architectural design specified in ZK_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN.md
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility while improving code quality
- Testing strategy aligns with documentation in tests/docs directory
- The real wallet test harness requires a funded wallet on Polygon Amoy testnet
- Updated from Sepolia to Polygon Amoy to align with the project's target network
