# Revised Zero-Knowledge Proof Infrastructure Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK) infrastructure for the Proof of Funds system. The goal is to develop a robust, maintainable, and efficient ZK system that integrates seamlessly with the existing UI while providing enhanced privacy features.

## Core Components

### 1. snarkjs and WebAssembly Integration

**Approach:**
- Implement a robust integration with the snarkjs library that handles runtime availability
- Support both browser and Node.js environments with specialized optimizations for each
- Provide consistent fallbacks for development and testing
- Handle WebAssembly (WASM) loading, execution, and potential failures

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// Dynamic import with proper WASM handling and error recovery
export const initializeSnarkJS = async () => {
  if (!snarkjsInstance) {
    try {
      // Check if WebAssembly is supported
      if (typeof WebAssembly === 'undefined') {
        console.warn('WebAssembly is not supported in this environment');
        throw new Error('WebAssembly not supported');
      }
      
      // Attempt to load snarkjs
      const snarkjs = await import('snarkjs').catch(e => {
        console.error('Failed to load snarkjs:', e);
        return null;
      });
      
      if (snarkjs) {
        // Handle different versions of snarkjs
        if (typeof snarkjs.initialize === 'function') {
          // Modern versions with explicit initialization
          snarkjsInstance = await snarkjs.initialize().catch(e => {
            console.error('Failed to initialize snarkjs:', e);
            return null;
          });
        } else {
          // Direct import
          snarkjsInstance = snarkjs;
        }
        
        // Verify that WASM functionality is working
        if (!snarkjsInstance.wasm) {
          console.warn('snarkjs WASM module not available');
          throw new Error('snarkjs WASM module not available');
        }
      } 
      
      if (!snarkjsInstance) {
        throw new Error('snarkjs initialization failed');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Local proof generation unavailable, switching to server-side fallback');
      // Create server-side fallback implementation
      snarkjsInstance = createServerSideFallback();
    }
  }
  return snarkjsInstance;
};

// Server-side fallback that offloads computation when browser can't handle it
const createServerSideFallback = () => {
  return {
    // API that matches snarkjs but routes requests to server
    generateProof: async (inputs, circuit) => {
      // Send proof generation request to server
      const response = await fetch('/api/zk/generate-proof', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ inputs, circuit })
      });
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Server-side proof generation failed');
      }
      
      return await response.json();
    },
    // Other methods following same pattern...
  };
};
```

### 2. Memory Management and Performance

**Resource Management Approach:**
- Implement progressive and chunked computation for memory-intensive operations
- Provide memory usage monitoring and graceful degradation options
- Utilize Web Workers for computationally intensive tasks
- Set clear benchmarks and hardware recommendations

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// Memory-aware proof generation with Web Worker offloading
export const generateProofWithMemoryAwareness = async (inputs, circuit) => {
  // Check available memory if possible
  const performanceInfo = await checkPerformanceCapabilities();
  
  if (performanceInfo.isLowPoweredDevice || performanceInfo.limitedMemory) {
    // Use server-side fallback for low-powered devices
    return generateProofOnServer(inputs, circuit);
  }
  
  if (window.Worker && performanceInfo.supportsWorkers) {
    // Offload to Web Worker to prevent UI blocking
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const worker = new Worker('/zkProofWorker.js');
      
      worker.onmessage = (e) => {
        if (e.data.error) {
          reject(new Error(e.data.error));
        } else {
          resolve(e.data.proof);
        }
        worker.terminate();
      };
      
      worker.onerror = (e) => {
        reject(new Error('Proof generation failed in worker'));
        worker.terminate();
      };
      
      worker.postMessage({ inputs, circuit });
    });
  } else {
    // Fallback to chunked main thread computation with progress indication
    return generateProofChunked(inputs, circuit);
  }
};

// Performance capability detection
const checkPerformanceCapabilities = async () => {
  const memory = navigator.deviceMemory || 4; // Default to 4GB if not available
  const hardwareConcurrency = navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 2;
  
  return {
    isLowPoweredDevice: hardwareConcurrency < 2 || memory < 4,
    limitedMemory: memory < 8,
    supportsWorkers: typeof Worker !== 'undefined',
    // Other capability detections
  };
};
```

### 3. ZK Circuit Development

**Circuit Types:**

1. **Standard Proof Circuit**
   - Purpose: Prove ownership of exactly X amount
   - Inputs: Wallet address, actual balance, claimed amount
   - Outputs: Boolean verification result, commitment hash

2. **Threshold Proof Circuit**
   - Purpose: Prove ownership of at least X amount
   - Inputs: Wallet address, actual balance, threshold amount
   - Outputs: Boolean verification result, commitment hash

3. **Maximum Proof Circuit**
   - Purpose: Prove ownership of at most X amount
   - Inputs: Wallet address, actual balance, maximum amount
   - Outputs: Boolean verification result, commitment hash

**Circuit Design Principles:**
- Strictly isolated circuit implementations to prevent cross-circuit vulnerabilities
- Minimize constraints for gas efficiency with concrete optimization targets
- Ensure the wallet address is properly hashed with cryptographic security
- Use modular design for maintainability and circuit upgradeability
- Include safeguards against numerical edge cases (underflow/overflow)
- Design with clear circuit versioning for future upgrades

**Example Circuit Code (Circom):**
```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

// Version tagging for circuit compatibility management
// Changing this version should trigger verification key updates
pragma circuit_version 1.0.0;

include "node_modules/circomlib/circuits/comparators.circom";
include "node_modules/circomlib/circuits/poseidon.circom";

template ThresholdProof() {
    signal input actualBalance;
    signal input thresholdAmount;
    signal input walletAddressBytes[20]; // Ethereum address as bytes
    
    signal output isValid;
    signal output commitmentHash[2];
    
    // Check that actual balance is at least the threshold
    component greaterOrEqual = GreaterEqThan(252);
    greaterOrEqual.in[0] <== actualBalance;
    greaterOrEqual.in[1] <== thresholdAmount;
    isValid <== greaterOrEqual.out;
    
    // Create commitment hash from address and threshold
    component poseidonHash = Poseidon(22);
    
    // Input wallet address bytes
    for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        poseidonHash.inputs[i] <== walletAddressBytes[i];
    }
    
    // Add threshold amount and a type identifier
    poseidonHash.inputs[20] <== thresholdAmount;
    poseidonHash.inputs[21] <== 1; // Type identifier for threshold proof
    
    // Output commitment hash
    commitmentHash[0] <== poseidonHash.out[0];
    commitmentHash[1] <== poseidonHash.out[1];
}
```

### 4. Circuit Versioning and Compatibility

**Approach:**
- Implement explicit circuit versioning for all ZK circuits
- Maintain verification key registry with version mappings
- Ensure backward compatibility for verifying proofs from older circuits
- Define clear upgrade path for circuit improvements

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Circuit version registry for verification key management
const CIRCUIT_VERSIONS = {
  'standard': {
    '1.0.0': {
      wasmPath: '/circuits/standard_v1_0_0.wasm',
      zkeyPath: '/circuits/standard_v1_0_0.zkey',
      vkeyPath: '/circuits/standard_v1_0_0.vkey.json',
      maxInputSize: 10240,  // Maximum size in bytes for input data
      compatibleWith: ['1.0.0'],  // Compatible proof versions
      deprecated: false
    },
    // Future versions would be added here
  },
  'threshold': {
    '1.0.0': {
      wasmPath: '/circuits/threshold_v1_0_0.wasm',
      zkeyPath: '/circuits/threshold_v1_0_0.zkey',
      vkeyPath: '/circuits/threshold_v1_0_0.vkey.json',
      maxInputSize: 10240,
      compatibleWith: ['1.0.0'],
      deprecated: false
    }
  },
  'maximum': {
    '1.0.0': {
      wasmPath: '/circuits/maximum_v1_0_0.wasm',
      zkeyPath: '/circuits/maximum_v1_0_0.zkey',
      vkeyPath: '/circuits/maximum_v1_0_0.vkey.json',
      maxInputSize: 10240,
      compatibleWith: ['1.0.0'],
      deprecated: false
    }
  }
};

// Function to get compatible circuit version for verification
export const getCompatibleCircuitVersion = (proofType, proofVersion) => {
  const circuitVersions = CIRCUIT_VERSIONS[proofType];
  if (!circuitVersions) throw new Error(`Unknown proof type: ${proofType}`);
  
  // First check for exact match
  if (circuitVersions[proofVersion]) return circuitVersions[proofVersion];
  
  // Then look for compatible version
  for (const [version, config] of Object.entries(circuitVersions)) {
    if (config.compatibleWith.includes(proofVersion) && !config.deprecated) {
      console.log(`Using circuit version ${version} for ${proofType} proof version ${proofVersion}`);
      return config;
    }
  }
  
  throw new Error(`No compatible circuit version found for ${proofType} proof version ${proofVersion}`);
};
```

### 5. Proof Generation System

**Approach:**
- Modular design with separate functions for each proof type
- Clear error handling and validation with actionable error messages
- Support for both client-side and server-side generation with automatic fallback
- Memory-efficient processing for large balances
- Progress tracking and cancellation capability

**API Design:**
```typescript
/**
 * Generates a zero-knowledge proof for fund verification
 * 
 * @param params Configuration parameters for the proof
 * @param params.walletAddress The wallet address to verify
 * @param params.amount The amount to prove (in base units)
 * @param params.proofType The type of proof (STANDARD, THRESHOLD, MAXIMUM)
 * @param params.options Optional settings for proof generation
 * @param params.options.preferredLocation 'client'|'server' Where to generate proof
 * @param params.options.progressCallback Function to report progress (0-100)
 * @param params.options.abortSignal AbortSignal to cancel the operation
 * @returns Promise<ZKProofResult> The generated proof data
 */
export async function generateZKProof(params: ZKProofParams): Promise<ZKProofResult>

/**
 * Verifies a zero-knowledge proof against public parameters
 * 
 * @param params Parameters for verification
 * @param params.proof The serialized proof data
 * @param params.publicSignals The public signals for verification 
 * @param params.proofType The type of proof being verified
 * @param params.fallbackVerification Boolean to enable alternative verification path
 * @returns Promise<VerificationResult> Detailed verification result
 */
export async function verifyZKProof(params: ZKVerifyParams): Promise<VerificationResult>

/**
 * Detailed verification result with diagnostics
 */
export interface VerificationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  verificationMethod: 'standard'|'alternative'|'server';
  circuitVersion: string;
  verificationTime: number;
  errors?: string[];
  warnings?: string[];
}
```

### 6. Serialization/Deserialization

**Data Formats:**
- Proof data will be serialized as Base64-encoded JSON
- Public signals will be encoded as hex strings for blockchain compatibility
- Include version identifiers for future protocol upgrades
- Store circuit version metadata for verification compatibility checks

**Implementation:**
```javascript
export const serializeZKProof = (proof, publicSignals, circuitMeta) => {
  // Add version identifier and comprehensive metadata
  const wrappedProof = {
    version: '1.0.0',
    circuit: {
      type: circuitMeta.type, // 'standard', 'threshold', 'maximum'
      version: circuitMeta.version,
      constraints: circuitMeta.constraints // For informational purposes
    },
    proof: proof,
    publicSignals: publicSignals,
    metadata: {
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      generatorVersion: PACKAGE_VERSION, // From package.json
      environment: detectEnvironment()
    }
  };
  
  // Convert to Base64 for efficient storage/transmission
  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(wrappedProof)).toString('base64');
};

export const deserializeZKProof = (serializedData) => {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(serializedData, 'base64').toString('utf8'));
    
    // Validate required fields
    if (!data.version || !data.circuit || !data.proof || !data.publicSignals) {
      throw new Error('Invalid proof format: missing required fields');
    }
    
    // Version compatibility check
    validateProofVersion(data.version, data.circuit?.version);
    
    return {
      proof: data.proof,
      publicSignals: data.publicSignals,
      circuit: data.circuit,
      metadata: data.metadata
    };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Proof deserialization failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
};

// Validation helper
const validateProofVersion = (proofVersion, circuitVersion) => {
  // Check version compatibility
  const [proofMajor, proofMinor] = proofVersion.split('.').map(Number);
  const [circuitMajor, circuitMinor] = (circuitVersion || '0.0.0').split('.').map(Number);
  
  // Major version must match, minor can be greater on the proof side
  if (proofMajor !== CURRENT_MAJOR_VERSION) {
    console.warn(`Proof version ${proofVersion} may be incompatible with current system version ${PACKAGE_VERSION}`);
  }
};
```

### 7. Secure Key Management

**Approach:**
- Implement secure key storage for temporary wallets
- Never store private keys in plaintext in local storage
- Use proper encryption for keys at rest
- Implement key lifecycle management (creation, use, destruction)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Secure key management with proper encryption
export class SecureKeyManager {
  // Use the Web Crypto API for secure operations
  private crypto = window.crypto;
  
  // Generate a strong encryption key
  async generateEncryptionKey(password: string, salt?: Uint8Array): Promise<CryptoKey> {
    // Generate salt if not provided
    const keySalt = salt || this.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
    
    // Derive key using PBKDF2
    const keyMaterial = await this.crypto.subtle.importKey(
      "raw",
      new TextEncoder().encode(password),
      { name: "PBKDF2" },
      false,
      ["deriveBits", "deriveKey"]
    );
    
    return this.crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
      {
        name: "PBKDF2",
        salt: keySalt,
        iterations: 100000,
        hash: "SHA-256"
      },
      keyMaterial,
      { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
      false,
      ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
    );
  }
  
  // Encrypt a private key for storage
  async encryptPrivateKey(privateKey: string, password: string): Promise<EncryptedData> {
    const encryptionKey = await this.generateEncryptionKey(password);
    const iv = this.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
    
    const encryptedData = await this.crypto.subtle.encrypt(
      {
        name: "AES-GCM",
        iv: iv
      },
      encryptionKey,
      new TextEncoder().encode(privateKey)
    );
    
    return {
      encryptedKey: Array.from(new Uint8Array(encryptedData)),
      iv: Array.from(iv),
      // Store additional metadata for validation
      meta: {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        keyType: 'temp-wallet'
      }
    };
  }
  
  // Decrypt a stored private key
  async decryptPrivateKey(encryptedData: EncryptedData, password: string): Promise<string> {
    const encryptionKey = await this.generateEncryptionKey(password);
    
    try {
      const decrypted = await this.crypto.subtle.decrypt(
        {
          name: "AES-GCM",
          iv: new Uint8Array(encryptedData.iv)
        },
        encryptionKey,
        new Uint8Array(encryptedData.encryptedKey)
      );
      
      return new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted);
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Failed to decrypt private key: incorrect password or tampered data');
    }
  }
  
  // Securely store wallet data with session-only availability
  async securelyStoreWallet(walletData: any, sessionPassword: string): Promise<string> {
    const walletId = generateUniqueId();
    const encryptedPrivateKey = await this.encryptPrivateKey(
      walletData.privateKey,
      sessionPassword
    );
    
    // Store in sessionStorage, not localStorage for better security
    // This data is lost when the browser tab is closed
    sessionStorage.setItem(
      `temp-wallet-${walletId}`,
      JSON.stringify({
        id: walletId,
        address: walletData.address,
        encrypted: encryptedPrivateKey,
        expiresAt: Date.now() + (30 * 60 * 1000) // 30 minutes
      })
    );
    
    return walletId;
  }
}
```

### 8. Temporary Wallet System

**Purpose:**
- Generate deterministic temporary wallets for ZK proof submission
- Ensure these wallets cannot be linked to original user wallets
- Implement proper key management and lifecycle with security
- Include automated gas funding mechanism

**Implementation:**
```javascript
export class TemporaryWalletManager {
  private keyManager = new SecureKeyManager();
  
  // Generate a temporary wallet with proper security
  async generateTemporaryWallet({ chain, seed, sessionPassword }) {
    if (!sessionPassword) {
      // Generate secure random password for this session
      sessionPassword = generateSecureRandomPassword();
    }
    
    // Use HD wallet derivation (BIP44) with secure seed management
    const hdNode = ethers.utils.HDNode.fromMnemonic(
      seed || this.generateSecureSeed()
    );
    
    // Create unique path based on timestamp and strong random value
    const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    const random = this.generateCryptoRandom();
    const path = `m/44'/60'/0'/0/${timestamp + random}`;
    
    const wallet = hdNode.derivePath(path);
    
    // Securely store the wallet with encrypted private key
    const walletId = await this.keyManager.securelyStoreWallet(
      {
        address: wallet.address,
        privateKey: wallet.privateKey,
        path: path,
        chain
      },
      sessionPassword
    );
    
    // Schedule automatic wallet cleanup
    this.scheduleWalletCleanup(walletId);
    
    return {
      id: walletId,
      address: wallet.address,
      sessionPassword // Return this for the user to decrypt later
    };
  }
  
  // Generate cryptographically secure random number
  private generateCryptoRandom() {
    const randomBuffer = new Uint32Array(1);
    window.crypto.getRandomValues(randomBuffer);
    return randomBuffer[0];
  }
  
  // Generate secure mnemonic seed
  private generateSecureSeed() {
    // Generate at least 16 bytes (128 bits) of entropy for a secure mnemonic
    const entropy = ethers.utils.randomBytes(16);
    return ethers.utils.entropyToMnemonic(entropy);
  }
  
  // Securely retrieve wallet for transaction signing
  async getWalletForSigning(walletId, sessionPassword) {
    const walletData = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(`temp-wallet-${walletId}`));
    
    if (!walletData) {
      throw new Error('Temporary wallet not found or expired');
    }
    
    if (Date.now() > walletData.expiresAt) {
      sessionStorage.removeItem(`temp-wallet-${walletId}`);
      throw new Error('Temporary wallet has expired');
    }
    
    const privateKey = await this.keyManager.decryptPrivateKey(
      walletData.encrypted,
      sessionPassword
    );
    
    return new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
  }
  
  // Fund a temporary wallet for transaction submission
  async fundWalletForGas(walletId, provider, amount = '0.01') {
    const walletData = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(`temp-wallet-${walletId}`));
    if (!walletData) throw new Error('Temporary wallet not found');
    
    // Get funding from service wallet
    const serviceWallet = new ethers.Wallet(
      process.env.SERVICE_WALLET_KEY,
      provider
    );
    
    // Calculate gas needs based on network conditions
    const gasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();
    const gasNeeded = calculateRequiredGas(amount, gasPrice.toString());
    
    // Send transaction with retry mechanism
    let attempt = 0;
    const maxAttempts = 3;
    
    while (attempt < maxAttempts) {
      try {
        const tx = await serviceWallet.sendTransaction({
          to: walletData.address,
          value: ethers.utils.parseEther(gasNeeded)
        });
        
        // Wait for confirmation with timeout
        const receipt = await tx.wait(1);
        return receipt.transactionHash;
      } catch (error) {
        attempt++;
        if (attempt >= maxAttempts) throw error;
        // Exponential backoff before retry
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt)));
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Schedule wallet cleanup
  private scheduleWalletCleanup(walletId) {
    const walletData = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(`temp-wallet-${walletId}`));
    if (!walletData) return;
    
    const timeUntilExpiry = walletData.expiresAt - Date.now();
    
    // Schedule cleanup when wallet expires
    setTimeout(() => {
      sessionStorage.removeItem(`temp-wallet-${walletId}`);
      console.log(`Temporary wallet ${walletId} has been automatically cleaned up`);
    }, timeUntilExpiry);
  }
}
```

### 9. Gas and Blockchain Considerations

**Approach:**
- Implement dynamic gas estimation and management
- Fallback mechanisms for high gas situations
- Transaction monitoring and retry logic
- Cost estimation for different proof types

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Gas management for blockchain transactions
export class GasManager {
  private provider;
  
  constructor(provider) {
    this.provider = provider;
  }
  
  // Calculate optimal gas parameters based on network conditions
  async calculateOptimalGasParams(txType = 'standard') {
    const gasPrice = await this.provider.getGasPrice();
    
    // Get EIP-1559 fee data if available
    let maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas;
    try {
      const feeData = await this.provider.getFeeData();
      maxFeePerGas = feeData.maxFeePerGas;
      maxPriorityFeePerGas = feeData.maxPriorityFeePerGas;
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('EIP-1559 fee data not available, using legacy gas pricing');
    }
    
    // Add premium based on transaction type
    const gasMultiplier = this.getGasMultiplierForType(txType);
    
    if (maxFeePerGas && maxPriorityFeePerGas) {
      // EIP-1559 transaction
      return {
        maxFeePerGas: maxFeePerGas.mul(gasMultiplier),
        maxPriorityFeePerGas: maxPriorityFeePerGas.mul(gasMultiplier)
      };
    } else {
      // Legacy transaction
      return {
        gasPrice: gasPrice.mul(gasMultiplier)
      };
    }
  }
  
  // Get gas multiplier based on transaction type
  private getGasMultiplierForType(txType) {
    switch (txType) {
      case 'fast': return ethers.BigNumber.from(15).div(10); // 1.5x
      case 'standard': return ethers.BigNumber.from(12).div(10); // 1.2x
      case 'slow': return ethers.BigNumber.from(10).div(10); // 1.0x
      default: return ethers.BigNumber.from(12).div(10); // 1.2x
    }
  }
  
  // Estimate gas cost for operation
  async estimateOperationCost(
    operationType,
    proofCount = 1,
    proofType = 'standard'
  ) {
    // Base gas costs by operation and proof type
