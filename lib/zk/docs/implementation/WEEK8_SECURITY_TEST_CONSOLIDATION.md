# Week 8: Security Test Framework Consolidation

## Background

During the Week 8 implementation, we identified duplicate security test files that performed similar functions but had different implementations. This duplication was causing maintenance issues and potentially creating blind spots in our security testing.

The duplicate files were:
1. `AttackVectorTest.js` and `AttackVectors.js`
2. `MITMTest.js` and `ManInTheMiddleTest.js`

## Consolidation Approach

We analyzed the files to determine which were actively used in the codebase and which contained more thorough implementations. Based on this analysis, we:

1. Kept the more actively used files (`AttackVectorTest.js` and `MITMTest.js`)
2. Incorporated unique functionality from the duplicate files
3. Updated references and documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `MITMTest.js`

- Added denial of service (DoS) attack testing from `ManInTheMiddleTest.js`
- Added DoS attack to the `attackTypes` array in the constructor
- Implemented a new `testDenialOfService()` method with:
  - Rate limiting detection
  - Circuit breaker detection
  - Resource monitoring simulation

### 2. Enhanced `AttackVectorTest.js`

- Added nullifier reuse attack testing from `AttackVectors.js`
- Added identity spoofing attack testing from `AttackVectors.js`
- Added both new attack types to the `attackVectors` array in the constructor
- Implemented `testNullifierReuse()` method to test protection against reusing the same nullifier
- Implemented `testIdentitySpoofing()` method to test protection against identity spoofing attacks

### 3. Updated `run-security-tests.mjs`

- Updated documentation to reference new attack vectors
- Added comments explaining the enhanced capabilities of both test classes

## Benefits

This consolidation:

1. **Reduces code duplication** - Eliminated redundant test files
2. **Improves test coverage** - Incorporated unique tests from all implementations
3. **Simplifies maintenance** - Single source of truth for each security test type
4. **Standardizes implementation** - All security tests now extend the `SecurityTest` base class
5. **Enhances documentation** - Clear comments about test capabilities and requirements

## Next Steps

- Consider deleting the now-redundant `AttackVectors.js` and `ManInTheMiddleTest.js` files
- Run the enhanced security tests against the ZK implementation to identify any new vulnerabilities
- Update the regression tests to reflect the consolidated security testing framework
