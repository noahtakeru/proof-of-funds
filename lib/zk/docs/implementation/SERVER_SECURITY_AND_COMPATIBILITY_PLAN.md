# Server-Side Security Enhancement and Compatibility Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to address two critical areas for financial-grade implementation of the ZK infrastructure:

1. **Server-Side Component Security Enhancement**: Improve server-side fallbacks to maintain the same level of security as client-side operations.
2. **Browser Compatibility Testing Matrix**: Ensure all ZK functionality works consistently across all target browsers and environments.
3. **Code Optimization**: Remove redundant code and ensure thorough implementation across all modules.

## 1. Server-Side Component Security Enhancement

### Current Assessment

Our fallback system routes proof generation and verification to server-side components when browser capabilities are insufficient. These components need security enhancements to match client-side integrity.

After thorough review of the zkProxyClient.js and server-side handlers (fullProve.js, verify.js, status.js, verificationKey.js), I've identified the following server-side security patterns:

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive rate limiting with per-user, per-minute, per-hour, burst, and concurrent request controls
- Request queuing and prioritization for effective resource management
- Detailed error handling with proper abstraction via specialized error classes
- Progress tracking and reporting capabilities
- Automatic detection of execution modes based on browser capabilities
- Intelligent fallback mechanisms when client-side execution fails
- API key verification system for controlling server access
- Input validation for different proof types
- Proper handling of CORS and preflight requests
- Performance monitoring and telemetry
- Server status checks for health monitoring
- Secure handling of verification keys

**Security Gaps:**
1. **Anti-Replay Protection**: Missing nonce/timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks on server-side operations
2. **Request Signatures**: No cryptographic request signing to verify client authenticity 
3. **Input Consistency Validation**: While basic input validation exists, there's limited cross-field validation
4. **Server Response Authentication**: Responses lack cryptographic signatures that would prevent MITM tampering
5. **Data Protection in Transit**: No additional encryption beyond TLS for highly sensitive inputs
6. **Proof Serialization Security**: Potential information leakage through detailed proof serialization
7. **Client Identity Verification**: Reliance on simple user IDs rather than strong identity verification
8. **Error Message Information Leakage**: Some error responses may leak implementation details
9. **Security Event Monitoring**: Limited integration with security monitoring systems
10. **Missing Request Origin Validation**: Limited checks on request origins
