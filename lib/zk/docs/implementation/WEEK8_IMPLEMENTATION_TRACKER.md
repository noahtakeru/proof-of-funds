# Week 8 Implementation Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress for Week 8 tasks of the ZK infrastructure plan. Week 8 focuses on deployment readiness, system integration, and production optimization to ensure the platform is ready for real-world usage.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Multi-platform Deployment Manager
- [x] Specification review
- [x] Core implementation
- [x] Tests
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Integration

A robust deployment manager that handles different environments (browser, Node.js, mobile) with environment-specific configurations, feature detection, and health checks.

### Task 2: Performance Optimization Framework
- [x] Specification review
- [x] Core implementation
- [x] Tests
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Integration

A comprehensive framework for measuring and optimizing performance, including benchmarking, memory optimization, intelligent caching, and performance telemetry.

### Task 3: End-to-End Integration Testing
- [x] Specification review
- [x] Core implementation
- [x] Tests
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Integration

An integration testing framework for the entire system with support for different configurations, automated reporting, and end-to-end workflow testing.

## Success Criteria
Each task must meet the following criteria to be considered complete:

1. **Full Implementation**: No placeholder or mock code
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Documentation**: Clear and detailed documentation
4. **Regression Test**: Pass all regression tests including previous weeks
5. **Integration**: Proper integration with other components

## Timeline
- Start Date: April 13, 2025
- Target Completion: April 20, 2025

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
âœ… All tasks implemented and passing tests.

### Technical Considerations
- Maintained compatibility with both ESM and CommonJS module systems
- Ensured all components work with the existing contract infrastructure
- Implemented browser compatibility support across different platforms
- Optimized for both development and production environments

### Dependencies
- Week 7 implementation (Contract Interfaces, Gas Management, Verification Pathways)
- Existing smart contracts (ProofOfFunds.sol, ZKVerifier.sol)
- Browser compatibility infrastructure
