## Implementation Details

### 1. Server-Side Security Enhancements

#### Anti-Replay Protection

Implemented a robust `NonceValidator` system to prevent replay attacks:

- Time-based expiration mechanism with TTL
- User/session-specific nonce tracking
- Memory-efficient storage with automatic cleanup
- Clock skew tolerance for distributed systems
- Optional strict ordering of nonces

The nonce validation system was integrated into all server endpoints and client requests, creating a seamless protection layer against replay attacks.

#### Request Signature Verification

Implemented a `RequestSignatureVerifier` to ensure request authenticity:

- Support for asymmetric cryptography (RSA)
- HMAC fallback for compatibility
- Client key management system
- Signature timestamp validation
- Detailed verification reporting

This system ensures that all requests to sensitive endpoints can be cryptographically verified, preventing request forgery and ensuring authenticity.

#### Enhanced Input Validation

Created a comprehensive `InputValidator` with cross-field validation:

- Field-level validation rules for all input parameters
- Cross-field validation for related parameters
- Schema-based validation for different proof types
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Detailed validation error reporting

This validation system ensures that all inputs are thoroughly verified before processing, preventing a wide range of injection and manipulation attacks.

#### Response Signing

Implemented `ResponseSigner` to protect against response tampering:

- Cryptographic response signing
- Automatic key rotation
- Client-side verification
- Timestamp-based replay protection

This system ensures that clients can verify the authenticity of server responses, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and response manipulation.

### 2. Browser Compatibility Framework

#### Browser Testing Matrix

Created a comprehensive browser compatibility matrix:

- Detailed browser and version support definitions
- Platform-specific compatibility information
- Feature requirements for each operation
- Graceful degradation paths

This matrix provides clear guidance on supported environments and expected functionality across different browsers and platforms.

#### Feature Detection System

Implemented detailed browser feature detection:

- Comprehensive testing of WebAssembly capabilities
- Web Crypto API feature detection
- Memory and performance assessment
- Storage capability detection
- Networking feature evaluation

This system allows the application to make informed decisions about execution modes based on browser capabilities.

#### Compatibility Testing Infrastructure

Created a complete browser compatibility testing infrastructure:

- Automated test runner for browser features
- Feature-specific test implementations
- Performance benchmarking
- Detailed test reporting
- HTML test runner interface

This infrastructure enables thorough testing of browser compatibility and generates detailed reports for analysis.

### 3. Code Standardization

#### Module Export Standardization

Implemented `ModuleStandardizer` to create consistent module exports:

- Support for both ESM and CommonJS formats
- Standardized export patterns
- Class export utilities
- Conversion tools for different module formats

This standardization ensures consistent module usage across the codebase and improves interoperability between different module systems.

#### Code Deduplication

Consolidated duplicate implementations and extracted common patterns:

- Identified and eliminated redundant code
- Created shared utilities for common operations
- Standardized implementation approaches
- Improved code reuse across components

This consolidation improves maintainability, reduces bugs from divergent implementations, and simplifies future development.

#### Error Handling Standardization

Standardized error handling across all components:

- Consistent use of specialized error classes
- Standardized error metadata
- Uniform error logging patterns
- Consistent error recovery approaches

This standardization ensures that errors are handled consistently throughout the application, improving reliability and debugging.
