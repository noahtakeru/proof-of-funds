# Codebase Streamlining Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to streamline the ZK infrastructure codebase, focusing on reducing unnecessary complexity while preserving and enhancing real functionality. Our goal is to create a more maintainable, testable, and production-ready codebase that prioritizes working code over theoretical frameworks.

## Current Issues and Challenges

- Over-engineering in multiple components, with some files exceeding 2,000 lines
- "Test-driven implementation" approach taken too far, with sophisticated test frameworks checking for methods that contain mostly mock implementations
- Core components like GasManager have grown by 30%+ in line count while primarily adding complexity around the edges rather than improving core functionality
- Heavy reliance on mocks (673 instances of "mock" terms) creating a false sense of progress
- Overengineered components with extensive inheritance hierarchies
- Complex error handling systems that add verbosity without proportional value

## Core Philosophy

- Focus on implementing real, production-ready functionality
- Eliminate unnecessary complexity and abstraction
- Prioritize testable, working code over planning documents
- Ensure all components have real implementations, not placeholders
- Break large modules into smaller, focused components
- Use composition over inheritance for adapter patterns
- Reduce parameter count in methods (target 3-4 max)
- Document distinction between implemented vs. placeholder functionality

## 1. Component Analysis

### Components to Streamline

### Code Simplicity Principles

1. **Size Limits**
   - Maximum 100-150 lines per file for new implementations
   - Maximum 500-700 lines for complex functionality (reduced from existing files exceeding 2,000 lines)
   - No more than 7-8 methods per class
   - Methods should have at most 3-4 parameters

2. **Architecture Principles**
   - Single responsibility per class/module
   - Direct implementations over abstract factories
   - Simplify error handling (consolidate error types and use standard patterns)
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Minimize inheritance depth (max 2 levels)
   - Favor functional approaches where appropriate

3. **Practical Focus**
   - Implement solutions that solve immediate problems
   - Avoid premature optimization and abstraction
   - Focus on working code over planning documents
   - Use real-world test cases to validate functionality

### Documentation Standards

1. **Code Documentation**
   - Document parameters, return values, and error conditions
   - Include usage examples for complex functions
   - Document public API methods thoroughly
   - Clearly distinguish between fully implemented and placeholder functionality

2. **Usage Documentation**
   - Focus on how code should be used, not internal details
   - Provide clear examples for key functionality
   - Document error scenarios and recovery
   - Include performance considerations and resource requirements

3. **Implementation Notes**
   - Explain complex algorithms or cryptographic operations
   - Document performance implications
   - Note browser compatibility concerns
   - Explicitly document any remaining mocks in MOCKS.md
