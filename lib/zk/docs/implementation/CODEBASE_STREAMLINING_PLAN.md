# Codebase Streamlining Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to streamline the ZK infrastructure codebase, focusing on reducing unnecessary complexity while preserving and enhancing real functionality. Our goal is to create a more maintainable, testable, and production-ready codebase that prioritizes working code over theoretical frameworks.

## Core Philosophy

- Focus on implementing real, production-ready functionality
- Eliminate unnecessary complexity and abstraction
- Prioritize testable, working code over planning documents
- Ensure all components have real implementations, not placeholders

## 1. Component Analysis

### Components to Streamline

| Component | Current Size | Target Size | Complexity Reduction |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| GasManager.js | 73,462 bytes | ~30,000 bytes | 60% |
| Deployment Framework | 7+ files | 2-3 files | 70% |
| Security Framework | 20+ files | 5-6 core files | 75% |
| Module Format System | 10+ files | 3-4 files | 60% |

### Components to Keep and Enhance

| Component | Current Status | Enhancement Focus |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Circuit Testing Framework | Partially implemented | Add real cryptographic validation |
| Error Handling Framework | Core implementation exists | Simplify types while maintaining logging |
| Admin Dashboard Components | Basic functionality | Focus on core features without abstraction |
| Proof Verification | Core verification works | Add comprehensive testing |

## 2. Implementation Prioritization Matrix

| Component | Business Value | Implementation Complexity | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Circuit Testing | High | Medium | HIGH |
| Error Handling | High | Low | HIGH |
| Proof Verification | High | High | HIGH |
| Gas Optimization | Medium | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Security Rules | Medium | High | LOW |
| Deployment Adapters | Low | High | LOW |
