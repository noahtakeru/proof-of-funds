# UI Module Standardization Tracker

This document tracks the progress of standardizing UI component modules as part of the Module Standardization Plan.

## Overview

The UI module standardization involves:
1. Converting ESM modules with `.js` extensions to `.mjs`
2. Adding proper extensions to imports
3. Fixing mixed module formats
4. Preserving TypeScript React (`.tsx`) files

## Component Groups

| Component Group | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Basic Components | Completed | ConnectWallet.mjs, Footer.mjs, Layout.mjs, Navbar.mjs, etc. |
| Admin Components | Completed | AuditLogs.mjs, Dashboard.mjs, etc. |
| Security Components | Completed | Verification.mjs |
| API Routes | Completed | Fixed mixed module format in pages/api/zk/fullProve.js |
| Pages | Completed | index.mjs, about.mjs, etc. |

## Standardized Files

### Mixed Module Format Files

1. **pages/api/zk/fullProve.js**
   - ✅ Fixed: Converted CommonJS requires to dynamic imports
   - Used for server-side proof generation
   - Now uses consistent ESM format

### Files with Extensions Fixed

The following files had their extensions and imports standardized:
- components/ConnectWallet.mjs (was ConnectWallet.js)
- components/WalletSelector.mjs (was WalletSelector.js)
- All UI components and pages (26 files total)

## Implementation Progress

| Date | Task | Status | Details |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 2025-04-26 | Create standardization script | Completed | Created ui-module-standardizer.mjs |
| 2025-04-26 | Run initial analysis | Completed | Identified 28 files needing standardization |
| 2025-04-26 | Fix mixed module format file | Completed | Fixed pages/api/zk/fullProve.js |
| 2025-04-26 | Standardize component imports | Completed | Fixed imports in 26 files |
| 2025-04-26 | Rename .js to .mjs for ESM files | Completed | Renamed 26 files from .js to .mjs |
| 2025-04-26 | Verify standardization | Completed | Generated detailed report |

## Testing Strategy

1. ✅ Run standardization script on UI components
2. ✅ Verify automatic standardization output
3. ✅ Check for any errors or issues during standardization
4. ⏳ Test Next.js build to verify components still render correctly
5. ⏳ Test end-to-end functionality with standardized modules
6. ⏳ Run regression tests to ensure no regression in behavior

## Completion Criteria

- ✅ All UI component files follow standardized module format rules
- ✅ No mixed module pattern warnings in UI components
- ✅ All imports use proper extensions and patterns
- ⏳ UI components render and function correctly
- ⏳ API routes work correctly with standardized modules
- ⏳ All regression tests pass with standardized modules

## Follow-up Actions

1. Run Next.js build to verify the changes work correctly
2. Run regression tests to ensure no regressions
3. Verify that the standardized modules work with Next.js SSR
4. If needed, create any necessary adapter files for Next.js configuration
