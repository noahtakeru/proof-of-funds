# Week 14.5 Implementation Tracker

## Overview
Week 14.5 focuses on finalizing the ZK infrastructure with comprehensive documentation, robust deployment pipelines, and a staged rollout process. This document tracks implementation progress across all tasks to ensure successful deployment and knowledge transfer.

## Task Status

| Task | Description | Status | Completion % | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1. Complete Documentation | Create comprehensive developer and user documentation | In Progress | 10% | API reference, user guides, security documentation, architecture docs, and maintenance guides implementation started |
| 2. Deployment Pipeline | Configure robust CI/CD for production deployment | Not Started | 0% | Will implement build process, environment promotion, rollback mechanisms, feature flags, and release process |
| 3. Staged Rollout | Deploy to internal users, beta testers, collect feedback | Not Started | 0% | Will implement internal testing, beta program, feedback collection, production deployment plan |
