## Implementation Notes

### 2023-10-25

- Created the directory structure for the security framework components
- Implemented AuditConfig.js with comprehensive configuration options:
  - Customizable security rules with severity levels
  - Fine-grained control over what files and directories to scan
  - Support for custom rules and rule weights
- Implemented SecurityAuditor.js with the following features:
  - Support for scanning individual files or entire directories
  - Extensible rule system for detecting different types of security issues
  - Output in multiple formats (JSON, text, HTML)
  - Integration with the error handling system

## Next Steps

1. Implement the various detectors for specific security vulnerabilities
2. Create the penetration testing framework and attack simulators
3. Implement the security monitoring system
4. Create documentation
5. Implement tests
6. Review and finalize
