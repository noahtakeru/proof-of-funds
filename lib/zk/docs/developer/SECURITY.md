## Security Properties

The Zero-Knowledge Proof System provides the following key security properties:

### Zero-Knowledge
The system ensures that proofs reveal no information beyond the validity of the statement being proven. This means that when proving ownership of a certain amount of funds, the exact balance, transaction history, and other related information remain completely private.

### Soundness
It is computationally infeasible to generate a valid proof for a false statement. This property ensures that if a verification passes, the statement is mathematically guaranteed to be true.

### Completeness
For any true statement, there exists a valid proof that will be accepted by the verifier. This ensures that legitimate users can always create valid proofs for truthful claims.

### Non-Interactivity
Proofs can be verified without interaction with the prover, enabling asynchronous verification and broader applications.

### Tamper-Resistance
Proofs cannot be modified after creation without invalidating them, ensuring integrity of the verified statements.

## Threat Model

The system is designed to withstand the following threats:

### External Threats

1. **Network Eavesdroppers**: Attackers monitoring network traffic to capture sensitive information
2. **Malicious Verifiers**: Entities attempting to extract more information than what's being proven
3. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Intercepting and potentially altering communications
4. **Replay Attacks**: Capturing and replaying valid proofs in different contexts
5. **Denial of Service**: Attempts to overwhelm system resources to disrupt service

### Internal Threats

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Extracting information through timing, power consumption, or other indirect channels
2. **Memory Attacks**: Attempting to read sensitive information from memory
3. **Cryptographic Weaknesses**: Exploiting weaknesses in cryptographic implementations
4. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromising dependencies to introduce vulnerabilities

### User-Related Threats

1. **Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing sensitive information
2. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating users to perform actions that compromise security
3. **Weak Credentials**: Using easily guessable passwords or insecure key storage

### Key Storage

User keys are protected with:

1. **Client-Side Protection**:
   - Keys never leave the user's device
   - Hardware secure elements used when available (TPM, Secure Enclave)
   - Memory protection to prevent key extraction
   - Key encryption at rest

2. **Key Encapsulation**:
   - Keys are encapsulated within protected objects
   - Multiple layers of encryption
   - Anti-tampering mechanisms
