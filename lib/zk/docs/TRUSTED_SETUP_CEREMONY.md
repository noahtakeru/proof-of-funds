# Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Ceremony for Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Overview

This document outlines the complete Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ceremony process for generating secure parameters for our zero-knowledge proof system. An MPC ceremony is a cryptographic protocol that allows multiple independent parties to jointly compute a set of parameters while ensuring that no single party can compromise the security of the system.

## Importance of the Trusted Setup

Zero-knowledge proof systems, particularly those based on zk-SNARKs, require a set of public parameters (sometimes called the "Common Reference String" or CRS) that must be generated in a special ceremony before the system can be used.

The security of these parameters is critical because:

1. **Privacy Risk**: If the "toxic waste" (secret randomness used to generate parameters) is known by an attacker, they could generate false proofs that appear valid.
2. **Integrity Risk**: Compromised parameters could allow the creation of fraudulent proofs that falsely claim funds or balances.

A properly conducted MPC ceremony addresses these risks through a process that ensures security as long as at least one participant is honest.

## Participant Roles and Responsibilities

### Ceremony Coordinator
- Responsible for organizing the ceremony and managing the overall process
- Sets up the initial parameters and verification infrastructure
- Validates the mathematical correctness of contributions
- Does not directly contribute to the parameters
- Publishes ceremony progress and results
- Ensures transparency throughout the process

### Participants (Contributors)
- Minimum required: 3 participants (more is better, 5+ recommended)
- Each participant must:
  - Generate secure randomness for their contribution
  - Keep their randomness secret during and after the ceremony
  - Verify the parameters received from previous participants
  - Apply their contribution and pass the updated parameters to the next participant
  - Destroy their randomness once contribution is complete
  - Publish proof of contribution for verification
  - Attest to following the correct procedure

### Verifiers
- Independent parties who validate the correctness of the ceremony
- Verify cryptographic proofs of each contribution
- Ensure the final parameters were generated according to protocol
- Provide public attestation of verification
- May include participants, non-participants, and the coordinator

### Auditors
- Technical experts who review the ceremony software and process
- Verify that the implementation matches specifications
- Ensure the ceremony follows best security practices
- Publish audit reports before and after the ceremony
