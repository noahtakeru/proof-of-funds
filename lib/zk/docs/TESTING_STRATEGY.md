# ZK Infrastructure Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Proof of Funds Zero-Knowledge (ZK) infrastructure. Our approach ensures that all components are thoroughly tested across different environments, edge cases are handled appropriately, and the system maintains its security and correctness guarantees.

## Testing Layers

The testing strategy is organized into multiple layers, each focusing on different aspects of the system:

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions and classes in isolation, using mocks for dependencies.

**Key characteristics:**
- Fast execution
- High granularity
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on pure logic

**Example areas:**
- Error handling classes
- Input validation
- Data transformation functions
- Parameter derivation

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different modules work correctly together, with minimal mocking.

**Key characteristics:**
- Test component interactions
- Verify API contracts
- Partial system testing
- Limited mocking

**Example areas:**
- Circuit registry with parameter derivation
- Error handler with recovery system
- Proof serialization with verification

### 3. Circuit Testing

Circuit-specific tests verify the correctness of the ZK circuits themselves.

**Key characteristics:**
- Constraint satisfaction
- Edge case detection
- Parameter boundary testing
- Circuit optimizations

**Example areas:**
- Standard proof circuit
- Threshold proof circuit
- Maximum proof circuit
- Circuit constraints

### 4. System Testing

System tests verify end-to-end functionality, including environment interactions.

**Key characteristics:**
- Full system flows
- Environment integration
- Real-world scenarios
- Performance testing

**Example areas:**
- Complete proof generation and verification flow
- Client-server fallback system
- Browser compatibility

### 5. Regression Testing

Regression tests ensure that previously completed work continues to function correctly.

**Key characteristics:**
- Automated test suite
- Comprehensive coverage
- Version-specific tests
- Technical debt verification

**Example areas:**
- Regression test runner
- Compatibility checks
- Module standardization

## Testing Tools & Frameworks

The following tools and frameworks are used for testing:

1. **Jest**: Primary test runner and assertion library
2. **Node.js**: Environment for running tests
3. **Browser testing**: Compatibility testing across browsers
4. **Circom**: Circuit testing and validation
5. **SnarkJS**: ZK proof generation and verification

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by category and component:

## Testing Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Where appropriate, we use test-driven development:
1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement code to pass the tests
3. Refactor for clean, maintainable code

### Mocking Strategy

The mocking strategy varies by test type:

- **Unit tests**: Heavy use of mocks to isolate functionality
- **Integration tests**: Limited mocking of external systems
- **System tests**: Minimal mocking, focus on real components

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage:
- **Core components**: 90%+ coverage
- **Utility functions**: 80%+ coverage
- **Edge cases**: Explicitly tested
- **Error paths**: Comprehensive coverage

## Specialized Testing

### Circuit Testing

ZK circuit testing includes:

1. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Verify circuits satisfy all constraints
2. **Witness Generation**: Test witness generation for valid inputs
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and special values
4. **Differential Testing**: Compare against reference implementations
5. **Gas Optimization**: Benchmark gas costs

### Browser Compatibility

Browser compatibility testing includes:

1. **Feature Detection**: Verify feature detection works correctly
2. **Performance Testing**: Measure performance across browsers
3. **Fallback Testing**: Verify fallback mechanisms work properly
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test on mobile browsers

### Security Testing

Security-focused testing includes:

1. **Input Fuzzing**: Test with randomized inputs
2. **Memory Analysis**: Check for memory leaks
3. **Side-Channel Testing**: Verify resistance to timing attacks
4. **Error Information Leakage**: Ensure errors don't leak sensitive data

## Continuous Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run fast tests before commits
2. **CI Tests**: Run full test suite on pull requests
3. **Nightly Tests**: Run extended tests overnight
4. **Release Testing**: Comprehensive testing before releases

## Regression Testing

The regression testing framework ensures:

1. **Task Verification**: Each completed task is verified
2. **Implementation Quality**: No placeholder code remains
3. **Module Compatibility**: Both ESM and CommonJS formats work
4. **Documentation**: Documentation is complete and accurate

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated to track:

1. **Test Coverage**: Which parts of the code are tested
2. **Performance Metrics**: How fast tests run
3. **Failure Analysis**: Detailed information on failures
4. **Regression Trends**: Whether performance improves or degrades

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements to the testing strategy:

1. **Property-Based Testing**: Add property-based tests for more robust validation
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add tests for UI components
3. **Load Testing**: Test system under high load
4. **Chaos Testing**: Test system resilience to failures
