/*
 * Standard Proof Circuit (version 1.0.0)
 * Proves exact balance amount for a given address
 * 
 * Input:
 * - address: Public input, the wallet address
 * - amount: Public input, the exact amount to prove
 * - nonce: Private input, random value to prevent correlation
 * - signature: Private input, signature proving ownership of wallet
 *
 * Optimization goals:
 * - Constraint count target: <10,000 constraints
 * - Uses Poseidon hash for efficient ZK operations
 * - Optimized signature verification
 *
 * ---------- NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION ----------
 * This is a mathematical template for creating a specific type of privacy proof - one that
 * proves you have EXACTLY a certain amount in your wallet (not more, not less).
 * 
 * Think of this like a specialized verification form that:
 * 1. Takes your wallet address and the exact amount you claim to have
 * 2. Privately checks that your actual balance matches this exact amount
 * 3. Verifies you actually own the wallet (through a digital signature)
 * 4. Creates mathematical proof that these checks passed without revealing your actual balance
 * 
 * It's like proving to someone you have exactly $10,000 in your bank account without
 * showing your bank statement or giving access to your account.
 * 
 * NOTE: This circuit contains some simplified/placeholder components (particularly in
 * the signature verification) that would need improvement for a production system.

    /* ---------- NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION ----------
     * This section verifies you own the wallet by checking your digital signature.
     * 
     * Think of a signature like a special stamp only you can create:
     * 1. The "walletSecret" is like your private stamping tool
     * 2. The "nonce" is a random number added to prevent reuse of your proof
     * 3. The system checks that your stamp matches what's expected for your address
     * 
     * NOTE: This is using a simplified verification model. A real system would use
     * a more robust signature check, but this is optimized for development.

     * This final step creates a secure "seal" for the verification:
     * 
     * 1. It combines your address, claimed amount, and the random nonce
     * 2. It creates a cryptographic "fingerprint" of this information
     * 3. This fingerprint becomes the output of the proof
     * 
     * This is like creating an official seal on a document that can be 
     * verified later without seeing the actual contents of the document.
