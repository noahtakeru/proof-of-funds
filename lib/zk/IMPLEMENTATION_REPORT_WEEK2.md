# Zero-Knowledge Infrastructure Implementation Report - Week 2

## Summary

This report documents the completion of Week 2 tasks for the Zero-Knowledge Proof infrastructure, as outlined in the ZK_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN.md document. The work focused on three main areas:

1. Basic Circuit Implementation
2. Core Utility Functions
3. Testing Infrastructure

The implementation follows the design guidelines and technical specifications outlined in the ZK_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN.md and ZK_INFRASTRUCTURE_PLAN_WEEK_2_CLARIFICATIONS.md documents.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Basic Circuit Implementation

The circuit implementations for all three proof types are now in place:

- `StandardProof.circom`: Proof of exact balance amount
- `ThresholdProof.circom`: Proof of minimum balance threshold
- `MaximumProof.circom`: Proof of maximum balance amount

Each circuit has been designed with:
- Appropriate input and output signals
- Proper constraint implementation
- Strong isolation between circuit types for security
- Version tagging for compatibility management

The circuits use the standard Circom 2.0.0 pragma and include necessary cryptographic primitives from circomlib.

### 2. Core Utility Functions

Several core utility modules have been implemented to support the ZK infrastructure:

#### A. Circuit Versioning Registry (`zkCircuitRegistry.js`)

This module provides:
- Circuit type and version management
- Compatibility checking between circuit versions
- Access to circuit artifacts (wasm, zkey, vkey files)
- Memory requirement estimation for different operations
- Functions to find compatible circuits for proofs

#### B. Device Capabilities Detection (`deviceCapabilities.js`)

This module implements:
- WASM, WebCrypto, and Web Workers support detection
- Device memory and CPU detection
- Device class categorization (high, medium, low, incompatible)
- Intelligent decision-making for client/server processing
- Memory requirement calculation for different operations

#### C. Progress Tracking (`progressTracker.js`)

This module provides:
- Percentage-based progress tracking
- Time remaining estimation
- Operation cancellation support via AbortSignal
- Step-by-step progress monitoring
- Registry for tracking multiple operations

#### D. Proof Serialization (`zkProofSerializer.js`)

This module implements:
- Serialization of proof data with metadata
- Versioning information for compatibility
- Extraction of proof data for verification
- Validity checking for proof containers
- Base64 encoding/decoding for efficient storage

#### E. Circuit Parameter Derivation (`zkCircuitParameterDerivation.js`)

This module implements:
- Generation of circuit parameters from transaction data
- Wallet address conversion to circuit-compatible format
- Proof-specific parameter derivation (Standard, Threshold, Maximum)
- Amount normalization for different token decimals
- Parameter validation to ensure circuit compatibility
- Client-side capability detection for proof generation
- Signature parameter handling for wallet ownership verification

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

A comprehensive testing framework has been established:

- Jest-based unit tests for all modules
- Test environment setup with proper mocking
- Tests for device capability detection
- Tests for circuit versioning and compatibility
- Tests for progress tracking functionality
- Tests for proof serialization and deserialization

The test suite covers both happy path scenarios and edge cases, ensuring robustness and reliability of the implementation.

## Integration with Existing Codebase

All new modules have been integrated with the existing ZK infrastructure:

- Added imports and exports in the main `index.js` file
- Structured as ES modules for compatibility with the project
- Organized into logical namespaces (utils, circuits, progress, serialization)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Next Steps

With Week 2 tasks complete, the implementation is ready to move to Week 3, which will focus on:

1. Temporary Wallet Architecture
2. Secure Key Storage
3. Client-Side Security

The groundwork laid in Week 2 provides a solid foundation for the security-focused work in Week 3, particularly:
- The device capabilities detection will help inform secure key management decisions
- The circuit versioning system will support secure parameter storage
- The progress tracking will be useful for long-running cryptographic operations

## Conclusion

The Week 2 implementation has successfully delivered all required components as specified in the plan. The implementation follows modern JavaScript practices, provides comprehensive test coverage, and integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.

The core utility functions provide a robust foundation for the remaining ZK infrastructure work, with a focus on performance, security, and user experience.
