# ZKP-Based Verification Platform Implementation Plan

## Rules
1. No mock or placeholder code. We want to know where we're failing.
2. If something is confusing, don't create crap - stop, make note and consult.
3. Always check if an implementation, file, test, architecture, function or code exists before making any new files or folders.
4. Understand the entire codebase (make sure you grok it before making changes).
5. Review this entire plan and its progress before coding.
6. If you make a new code file - indicate that this is new and exactly what it's needed for. Also make sure there isn't mock or placeholder crap code in here either. Fallback code is NOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER. WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN AND WHERE WE FAIL.
7. Unless a plan or test file was made during this phased sprint (contained in this document) - I'd assume it's unreliable until its contents are analyzed thoroughly. Confirm its legitimacy before proceeding with trusting it blindly. Bad assumptions are unacceptable.
8. Put all imports at the top of the file it's being imported into.
9. Record all progress in this document.
10. Blockchain testing will be done on Polygon Amoy, so keep this in mind.
11. Do not make any UI changes (to existing UI). I like the way the frontend looks at the moment.
12. Track your progress in this file. Do not make more tracking or report files. They're unnecessary.
13. Price estimates are unacceptable. We are building for production, so it's important to prioritize building working code that doesn't rely on mock data or placeholder implementation. NOTHING "FAKE".
14. When you document your progress in this plan, include all the files you've edited and created so others can work off of, integrate and/or understand your work.
15. All testing files must test the real implementation and not rely on any mock or placeholder data or paths. It's better to fail and have errors than make fake tests.
16. Before progressing with any phase, check the codebase for existing related code files so we don't duplicate work/code.
17. If a human is needed for anything, flag it to the human. There are likely some external services that are required. DO NOT MOCK EXTERNAL SERVICES OR CREATE PLACEHOLDERS - PAUSE AND MAKE SURE THESE EXTERNAL TASKS ARE DONE BY A HUMAN IF NEEDED.
18. Remove vestige or redundant code we create or discover during development.

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for extending the Proof of Funds protocol to support both consumer-facing self-service proofs and institutional verification workflows. The implementation maintains the existing consumer UX while adding sophisticated institutional features for custom verification templates, reference tokens, and compliance needs.

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan follows an incremental approach with clear priorities:

1. **EVM-First Strategy**: Starting with Ethereum/Polygon support and adding other chains incrementally
2. **Simplified Database**: Beginning with core tables and evolving the schema as needed
3. **Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**: Using established Circom trusted setups initially
4. **Focus on Core Value**: Implementing balance verification first, then extending with advanced features
5. **Executable Phasing**: Delivering a functional system in 12-14 weeks with a clear path for enhancement

## Project Phases

The implementation will be divided into eight primary phases, starting with a foundation phase to establish core infrastructure, followed by seven feature implementation phases. Each phase has specific deliverables and dependencies, designed to be executable in sequence with minimal disruption to the existing consumer platform.

## Human Intervention Requirements

Throughout the implementation, certain critical steps require human intervention. Development will pause at these points until the required human actions are completed. These are clearly marked with ðŸ”´ **HUMAN REQUIRED** tags.

### Required Human Actions Overview:

1. **External Service Setup**
   - GCP project configuration and service account creation
   - Blockchain node provider accounts (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
   - Polygon testnet contract deployment
   - Domain configuration and TLS certificates

2. **Trusted Setup Ceremony**

   - Extend ProofTemplate model with any essential fields
   - Add appropriate indexes for performance

3. Do NOT create or implement:
   - ReferenceToken model (Phase 5)

        // Add to active keys
        activeSigningKeys.push(keyHash);
        signingKeys[keyHash] = block.timestamp;
        
        emit SigningKeyRotated(
            keyHash,
            activeSigningKeys.length > 1 ? activeSigningKeys[activeSigningKeys.length - 2] : bytes32(0),
            block.timestamp,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
    
    // Verify if a signing key is valid
    function isValidSigningKey(bytes32 keyHash) external view returns (bool) {
        return signingKeys[keyHash] > 0;
    }
    
    // Anchor a batch of tokens
    function anchorBatch(
        bytes32 batchId,
        bytes32 merkleRoot,
        uint256 count
    ) external {
        require(batches[batchId].timestamp == 0, "Batch already exists");
        
        batches[batchId] = TokenBatch({
            merkleRoot: merkleRoot,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            count: count,
            submitter: msg.sender
        });
        
        emit BatchAnchored(
            batchId,
            merkleRoot,
            block.timestamp,
            count,
            msg.sender
        );
    }
    
    // Verify token inclusion in batch
    function verifyToken(

        if (revokedTokens[tokenId]) {

## Reference Token Cryptography

The reference token system uses a combination of cryptographic techniques to ensure token security, integrity, and privacy:

### Token Generation Process

1. **Proof Generation**:
   - Generate ZK proof based on user inputs and template requirements
   - Calculate proof hash using SHA-256

2. **Metadata Encryption**:
   - Generate AES-256-GCM encryption key
   - Encrypt selective metadata based on consent:
     - Wallet addresses (if consented)
     - Transaction summary (if consented)
     - Balance snapshots (if consented)
   - Store encryption key securely in GCP Secret Manager

3. **Token Creation**:
   - Generate UUID for token
   - Create token structure with all required fields
   - Retrieve active signing key from database
   - Generate cryptographic signature over token data using signing key
   - Store token in database with signing key reference

4. **On-Chain Anchoring**:
   - Generate Merkle tree from token batch
   - Submit Merkle root to Polygon contract
   - Store transaction hash and Merkle proof with token

### Token Verification Process

1. **Token Lookup**:
   - Retrieve token by ID
   - Verify token hasn't expired
   - Verify token hasn't been revoked

2. **Cryptographic Verification**:
   - Retrieve signing key referenced by token
   - Verify key was active when token was created
   - Verify token signature using signing key
   - Check nonce hasn't been used before
   - Verify Merkle proof against on-chain root

3. **Proof Verification**:
   - Verify ZK proof is valid
   - Verify proof hash matches token's proofHash
   - Check all template requirements are satisfied

4. **Metadata Decryption**:
   - Retrieve encryption key from GCP Secret Manager
   - Decrypt metadata based on verification permissions
   - Apply redaction based on consent levels

5. **Metadata Provenance Verification**:
   - Calculate hash of decrypted metadata
   - Verify calculated hash matches the metadataHash stored in the token
   - Verify metadataHash matches the value committed in the ZK proof
   - Return provenance verification status to user
   - Include provenance verification in audit log

### Security Measures

- **Replay Protection**: Single-use nonces prevent token reuse
- **Expiration**: Time-bound validity prevents indefinite use
- **Revocation**: On-chain revocation list allows invalidating compromised tokens
- **Selective Disclosure**: Encrypted metadata with consent-based access
- **Tamper Resistance**: Cryptographic signatures and Merkle proofs ensure integrity
- **Privacy**: ZK proofs reveal only the verification result, not the underlying data
- **Key Rotation**: Signing keys can be rotated without invalidating existing tokens

## Audit Logging System

The audit logging system provides a secure, tamper-evident record of all security-relevant events:

### Log Entry Structure

```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  id: string;                  // UUID for the log entry
  timestamp: number;           // Unix timestamp
  eventType: string;           // Type of event (e.g., 'auth.login', 'proof.generate')
  userId?: string;             // User who performed the action (if authenticated)
  organizationId?: string;     // Organization context (if applicable)
  resourceType?: string;       // Type of resource affected (e.g., 'token', 'proof')
  resourceId?: string;         // ID of the resource affected
  action: string;              // Action performed (e.g., 'create', 'verify', 'revoke')
  details: any;                // Event-specific details (sanitized)
  ipAddress?: string;          // IP address of the actor
  userAgent?: string;          // User agent of the actor
  hash: string;                // Hash of this log entry
  previousHash?: string;       // Hash of the previous log entry (for chain integrity)
}
```

### Logging Implementation

The audit logging system will be implemented as a secure, append-only service:

1. **Log Creation**:
   - Generate log entry with all relevant fields
   - Sanitize sensitive data from details
   - Calculate hash of entry combined with previous hash
   - Store log entry in database with hash chain

2. **Log Storage**:
   - Store logs in PostgreSQL with appropriate indexes
   - Implement log rotation and archiving policies
   - Create encrypted backup mechanism

3. **Log Access**:
   - Provide organization-specific log access
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Create exportable log formats (CSV, JSON)

4. **Tamper Evidence**:
   - Use hash chaining to detect log tampering
   - Periodically anchor log hash to blockchain
   - Implement log integrity verification

### Events to Log

- **Authentication Events**:
  - Login attempts (success/failure)
  - Token refresh
  - Password reset
  - Email verification

- **Proof Events**:
  - Proof generation
  - Proof verification
  - Template creation/modification
  - Consent grants/revocations

- **Token Events**:
  - Token creation
  - Token verification
  - Token revocation
  - On-chain anchoring

- **Administrative Events**:
  - Organization creation
  - User role changes
  - API key creation/revocation

  - Key rotation events

## Key Management System

The key management system provides secure handling of cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle:

### Signing Key Lifecycle

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Generate new key pair (private/public) using secure random source
   - Store private key in secure storage (GCP Secret Manager)
   - Store public key and metadata in database
   - Record key creation in audit log

2. **Key Activation**:
   - Set key status to active in database
   - Register key hash on-chain for external verification
   - Update key activation timestamp
   - Record activation in audit log

3. **Key Usage**:
   - Retrieve active key for signing operations
   - Track key usage statistics
   - Monitor for abnormal usage patterns
   - Record usage in audit log

4. **Key Rotation**:
   - Generate new key pair
   - Set new key as active
   - Mark old key as inactive
   - Register key rotation on-chain
   - Record rotation in audit log

5. **Key Deactivation**:
   - Set key status to inactive
   - Update key deactivation timestamp
   - Record deactivation in audit log

### Key Usage Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Keys are only accessible to services that require them
- **Key Isolation**: Different key types are isolated from each other
- **Usage Monitoring**: Key usage is monitored for anomalies
- **Regular Rotation**: Keys are rotated on a schedule
- **Revocation**: Compromised keys can be immediately revoked

### Key Types

- **Token Signing Keys**: Used to sign reference tokens
- **API Authentication Keys**: Used for API authentication
- **Encryption Keys**: Used for metadata encryption
- **Backup Keys**: Used for encrypted backups
