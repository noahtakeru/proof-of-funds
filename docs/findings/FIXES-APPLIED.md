## Issue: `loadAssets is not defined` Error

### Problem
- The `loadAssets` function was defined inside a `useEffect` hook
- This made it inaccessible to the refresh button's `onClick` handler
- Resulted in "loadAssets is not defined" error when clicking refresh

### Solution
1. **Moved `loadAssets` outside the useEffect**
   - Defined it as a `useCallback` hook at the component level
   - Made it accessible to all parts of the component

2. **Added `useCallback` import**
   ```javascript
   import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react';
   ```

3. **Updated the useEffect**
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Now just calls the external `loadAssets` function
   - Added `loadAssets` to the dependency array

4. **Helper functions**
   - Moved `tryGetCachedAssets` and `cacheAssets` outside useEffect
   - Made them regular functions accessible throughout the component

## Result
✅ No more "loadAssets is not defined" error  
✅ Refresh button works correctly  
✅ Assets load when wallets are selected  
✅ Cache functionality preserved  

## Files Modified
- `/packages/frontend/pages/create.js`

## Testing
The error should now be fixed. When you:
1. Connect wallets
2. Select wallets
3. Click the refresh button

The assets should reload without any errors.
