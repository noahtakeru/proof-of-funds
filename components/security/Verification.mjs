/**
 * Verification Component
 * 
 * This component handles verification of proof documents and signatures.
 * It provides both automated and manual verification processes.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Document hash verification
 * - Signature validation
 * - Timestamp confirmation
 * - Chain of custody tracking
 * - Interactive verification process
 * 
 * ---------- MOCK STATUS ----------
 * This file contains the following mock implementations:
 * - verifyDocument (line 42): Mock implementation of document verification that always returns true
 * - verifySignature (line 56): Mock implementation that validates signatures against hardcoded test values
 * - validateTimestamp (line 73): Mock function that assumes all timestamps are valid
 * 
 * These mocks are documented in MOCKS.md with priority HIGH for replacement.
 * 
 * Note: This is currently a simplified implementation.
 * Production version will implement complete cryptographic verification
 * against blockchain records and secure hash comparisons.
