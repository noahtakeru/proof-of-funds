# Circom Installation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. ✅ **Installed circom 2.2.2** from source using Rust
2. ✅ **Confirmed snarkjs 0.7.5** is already installed and functional
3. ✅ **Ran the circuit build script** (`real-build-circuits.cjs`) successfully
4. ✅ **Generated WebAssembly files** for all three proof types
5. ✅ **Verified file paths** for all necessary components:
   - WebAssembly files (`lib/zk/build/standardProof_js/standardProof.wasm`)
   - zkey files (`lib/zk/build/zkey/standardProof.zkey`)
   - Verification key files (`lib/zk/build/verification_key/standardProof.json`)

## Current Status & Issues

The installation and circuit compilation appear successful, but there are some integration issues:

1. **Witness Generation Issues**: When attempting to use the generated WebAssembly files with snarkjs, we encounter an error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')`. This suggests there might be:
   - Format incompatibilities between the generated WASM files and snarkjs
   - Input format issues for the circuit
   - Potential version mismatches between circom and snarkjs

2. **Test Integration**: The test suite is falling back to the mock implementation as designed, which is working as expected according to the senior engineer's guidance.

## Next Steps

As per the senior engineer's feedback, the current fallback/mock implementation is a deliberate design choice, and for most development purposes, it's sufficient. However, if real circuit execution is needed, here are the next steps:

1. **Investigate the WebAssembly Format**:
   - Check if the WASM files need additional processing
   - Ensure the circuit inputs match exactly what the circuit expects

2. **Alternative Approach**:
   - The Docker approach recommended in the guide might provide a more consistent environment
   - The Docker image is specifically configured to ensure compatibility between circom and snarkjs

3. **Consult with ZK Specialists**:
   - If real proof generation is critical, consult with ZK experts on the team
   - They can help debug specific circuit issues or format requirements

## Conclusion

You now have a working circom installation and successfully compiled circuits. The fallback mechanism is functioning as designed, which is suitable for most development work. For full ZK functionality, some additional debugging is needed, but this isn't urgent according to the senior engineer's feedback.
