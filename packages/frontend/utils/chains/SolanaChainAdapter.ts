/**
 * Solana Chain Adapter (Placeholder for future implementation)
 * 
 * This module provides a placeholder implementation of the ChainAdapter interface
 * for Solana blockchain. It will be expanded in a future phase of development.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is an intentional placeholder adapter that will be fully implemented 
 * in Phase 3.4 (Multi-Chain Extension) as described in the ZKP-PLATFORM-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md.
 * 
 * Current Status:
 * - Basic address validation is implemented
 * - All other methods throw "not implemented" errors
 * - This adapter should not be used in production until fully implemented
 * 
 * Implementation Plan:
 * - Phase 3.4 will implement full Solana SPL token and SOL balance verification
 * - Will leverage Solana Web3.js for blockchain data retrieval
 * - Will support both mainnet and testnet (devnet) environments
 * - Will include proper SPL token metadata retrieval
 * - Will implement proper signature verification using Solana standards
