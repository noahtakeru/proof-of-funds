# Browser-Based ZK Proof Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to enable browser-based ZK proof generation in the Proof of Funds application.

## Overview

The application now supports generating Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs in both server-side and browser environments. This allows for:

1. Enhanced privacy (proofs are generated locally in the browser)
2. Reduced server load (computation happens on client devices)
3. Improved scalability (no rate limits for local proof generation)
4. Better performance (less network latency)

## Implementation Approach

The core approach was to build on the existing Strategy pattern for ZK proof generation and make it environment-aware:

1. **Environment Detection**: Code now detects whether it's running in a browser or server environment
2. **File Path Management**: Different paths for accessing circuit files in different environments
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Attempting multiple paths to find the necessary files
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting in both environments
5. **Security Considerations**: Ensuring sensitive operations are environment-appropriate

## Key Changes

### 1. Filesystem Shim

Created a filesystem shim (`/utils/shims/fs/index.js`) that provides:
- Server: Real filesystem access through Node.js fs module
- Browser: URL-based file access through fetch API

### 2. Error Handling Shim

Enhanced the error handling shim (`/utils/shims/error-handling/index.js`) to:
- Make it fully compatible with the Next.js Pages Router
- Provide consistent validation across environments
- Support all error types needed for ZK operations

### 3. ZK Proof Strategies

Updated the strategy classes in `/utils/zkProofStrategies.js`:
- Added browser detection to all strategies
- Updated file paths to work in both environments
- Improved error handling with better context
- Added fallback paths for circuit files

### 4. Service Account Management

Modified the service account management (`/utils/serviceAccountManager.js`):
- Made it safe to use in browser environments
- Added mock implementations where needed
- Improved error handling for cross-environment use

## Circuit Files

For browser-based proofs, circuit files are now served from:
```
/public/lib/zk/circuits/
├── standardProof.wasm
├── standardProof.zkey
├── standardProof.vkey.json
├── maximumProof.wasm
├── maximumProof.zkey
├── maximumProof.vkey.json
├── thresholdProof.wasm
├── thresholdProof.zkey
└── thresholdProof.vkey.json
```

These files are accessible via HTTP in the browser environment.

## Testing & Verification

A test script (`/scripts/test-frontend-endpoints.js`) was created to verify:
- Circuit files can be found in both environments
- ZK proof generation works end-to-end
- Error handling behaves correctly

A setup script (`/scripts/complete-setup.sh`) was added to:
- Copy circuit files to the right locations
- Generate verification keys if needed
- Test the implementation

## Security Considerations

1. No sensitive information is exposed in the browser
2. Cloud credentials are only used in server environment
3. Circuit files are public by design (security through ZK cryptography)
4. Error handling redacts sensitive information

## Future Improvements

1. Add browser-specific optimizations for WASM loading
2. Implement client-side caching of circuit files
3. Add offline support for proof generation
4. Implement more robust fallback mechanisms
